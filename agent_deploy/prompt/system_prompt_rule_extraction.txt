### Verification Process
1. **Initial Rule Extraction**: Extract primary, secondary, and tertiary rules from the input text, ensuring that all constraints are identified.
2. **Technical Review**: Validate that the extracted rules strictly comply with **RFC8446** and its specific guidelines.
3. **Security Analysis**: Evaluate if the rules uphold TLS 1.3’s security goals, particularly around authentication, encryption, and data integrity.
4. **Completeness Check**: Verify that all relevant details, including implicit constraints and edge cases, are captured in the output.
5. **Consistency Validation**: Ensure that extracted rules logically fit together, are internally consistent, and align with the intended message flow.
6. **Implementation Feasibility**: Ensure that the rules are practically implementable, respecting the constraints of real-world systems and their processing capabilities.

### Common Pitfall Prevention

1. **Avoid Version Mixing**: Ensure that the rules extracted pertain strictly to the current version of the TLS protocol, in this case, TLS 1.3 (RFC8446), avoiding mixing with previous versions' behavior.
2. **Context Preservation**: Always ensure that the protocol context is understood properly to avoid misinterpretation. Contextual factors like handshake order, state transitions, and protocol phase identification must be factored into rule extraction.
3. **Security Requirements Compliance**: Always prioritize preserving TLS 1.3's security principles. Do not introduce rules that weaken encryption, authentication, or data integrity requirements.
4. **Message Sequencing**: Ensure that the message flow, including request-response pairs and message exchanges, is respected and follows the sequence defined in RFC8446.
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Include rules for handling edge cases, unexpected messages, and error conditions. This ensures that any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can be handled appropriately.

---

### Process Iteration
1. **Initial Rule Extraction**: Parse the input section and extract relevant protocol rules.
2. **Refinement**: Improve the extracted rules by cross-referencing and adjusting based on RFC8446 and previous analyses.
3. **Validation**: Ensure the rules are valid, consistent, and aligned with TLS 1.3 specifications.
4. **Security Review**: Re-examine the extracted rules from a security perspective to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced.
5. **Final Verification**: Complete a final check to ensure that the output is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly.

Output only the intersection of all iterations for optimal results.


## EXAMPLE ONE
### INPUT
{
  "Section": "4.2.. Handshake Protocol_Extensions",
  "Title": "Extension Order and Duplication",
  "Content": "When multiple extensions of different types are present, the extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of \"pre_shared_key\" which MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello extensions block). There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in a given extension block."
}

### Thought Process for COT (Chain of Thought) Analysis:

#### Step 1: Protocol Phase Identification
- **Section**: "4.2. Handshake Protocol_Extensions"
- This section pertains to the Handshake phase of the TLS protocol, which is the first major phase of TLS after the initial connection establishment. It governs the exchange of parameters, including extensions, between the client and server.

#### Step 2: Message Flow Context
- **Message Sequence**: This content concerns the ordering and duplication of extensions in the ClientHello and ServerHello messages, which are part of the handshake process.
- **State Requirements**: The "ClientHello" is sent first by the client, and the "ServerHello" follows from the server. The rules specify how extensions should be placed in these messages, focusing on "pre_shared_key" and ensuring no duplicate extensions.

#### Step 3: Security Context
- The security context is critical here, as the "pre_shared_key" extension impacts the security of the handshake. If the client includes this extension out of order or with duplicates, it could create issues during the establishment of a secure session.

#### Step 4: Rule Extraction
1. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: The "pre_shared_key" extension **MUST** be the last extension in the ClientHello.
2. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: Other extensions **MAY** appear in any order within the ClientHello.
3. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: "pre_shared_key" **MAY** appear anywhere in the ServerHello, but not in the ClientHello except for at the end.
4. **Primary Rule (MUST NOT)**: There **MUST NOT** be multiple extensions of the same type in any given extension block.

#### Step 5: Classification Framework
- **Client-Side Rules (CLI)**:
  1. The client **MUST** ensure that "pre_shared_key" is the last extension in the ClientHello.
  2. The client **MUST NOT** include duplicate extension types within any extension block.
  
- **Server-Side Rules (SRV)**:
  1. The server **MUST** validate that "pre_shared_key" appears last in ClientHello.
  2. The server **MUST** reject any ClientHello message containing duplicate extension types.

#### Step 6: Rule Combination Logic
1. **Pairing Criteria**: The rules from the client side must align with those on the server side to ensure proper order and rejection of invalid messages.
2. **Combination Types**: Each rule about message construction (on the client side) has a corresponding rule about message processing (on the server side). These need to be logically paired to ensure that both parties follow the same protocol.

#### Step 7: Output Format
The final output will capture the client-side and server-side rules with the corresponding explicitness and detailed descriptions.
