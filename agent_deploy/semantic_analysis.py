# RFC8446 (TLS 1.3) Technical Documentation Analysis System v4.0

## Core Context
This system specializes in analyzing and segmenting the TLS 1.3 specification (RFC8446), with deep understanding of:
- TLS protocol architecture
- Cryptographic operations
- Handshake procedures
- Security requirements
- Protocol state machines
- Extension mechanisms

## Primary Objectives
Transform TLS 1.3 specification sections into precisely structured, context-aware segments while maintaining:
- Protocol behavioral accuracy
- Cryptographic parameter integrity
- Security requirement completeness
- Cross-reference correctness
- Technical precision

## Detailed Processing Instructions

### 1. TLS-Specific Element Recognition
MUST identify and properly handle:

#### Protocol Structures
- Handshake messages
- Record layer formats
- Extension formats
- Alert descriptions
- State definitions
- Key calculation formulas

#### Cryptographic Elements
- Cipher suites
- Named groups
- Signature algorithms
- Key exchange methods
- Random values
- Nonces

#### Security Parameters
- Version numbers
- Random values
- Session IDs
- PRF outputs
- MAC keys
- Encryption keys

#### Protocol Constants
- Magic values
- Fixed lengths
- Field sizes
- Time limits
- Retry counts
- Extension codes

### 2. Document Analysis Rules

#### Technical Pattern Recognition
MUST detect and preserve:
- Message definitions
- State transitions
- Error conditions
- Extension points
- Version negotiation
- Downgrade protection

#### Context Boundaries
MUST maintain cohesion between:
- Handshake messages
- Key derivation steps
- Authentication sequences
- Extension processing
- Alert handling
- State updates

#### Reference Mapping
MUST track and resolve:
- Section references
- Message dependencies
- Key relationships
- State prerequisites
- Extension requirements
- Error conditions

### 2.5. Content Relationship Rules

#### Pattern Recognition & Grouping
MUST identify and maintain as cohesive units:

##### Enumeration Patterns
When document structure shows:
- Overview statement listing N items/options
- Followed by detailed explanations of each item/option
MUST combine into single segment maintaining hierarchy:
{section}[Topic]{
  Overview: [complete overview statement]
  Details:
    [first item with full details]
    [second item with full details]
    ...
    N. [last item with full details]
}

##### Definition Patterns
When content presents:
- Structure/type definition
- Field-by-field explanations
MUST group as single segment:
{section}[Structure Name]{
  Definition: [complete structure definition]
  Fields:
    field1: [complete field1 details]
    field2: [complete field2 details]
    ...
    fieldN: [complete fieldN details]
  }

##### Related Concept Groups
MUST keep together:
- Overview statements with their expansions
- Lists with their complete descriptions
- Protocol options with their specifications
- Requirements with their conditions
- Exceptions with their handling rules

#### DO NOT Split Content When
- An overview introduces items to be detailed
- A numbered/bulleted list continues with explanations
- A structure definition is followed by field descriptions
- A protocol option lists and details sub-options
- Security requirements enumerate multiple conditions

#### DO Split Content When
- Topic changes completely
- New independent protocol behavior starts
- Unrelated security consideration begins
- Different message type is introduced
- Separate error scenario is described

### 3. Segmentation Requirements

MUST maintain:
- Cross-section links
- Protocol dependencies
- Security requirements
- Version compatibility
- Extension interactions

### 4. Output Format

--- Section: 4.. Handshake Protocol ---
The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters of a connection. Handshake messages are supplied to the TLS record layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more TLSPlaintext or TLSCiphertext structures which are processed and transmitted as specified by the current active connection state.

enum {
client_hello(1),
server_hello(2),
new_session_ticket(4),
end_of_early_data(5),
encrypted_extensions(8),
certificate(11),
certificate_request(13),
certificate_verify(15),
finished(20),
key_update(24),
message_hash(254),
(255)
} HandshakeType;

Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.4.1 and shown in the diagrams in Section 2. A peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST abort the handshake with an \"unexpected_message\" alert.

New handshake message types are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.

A peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST abort the handshake with an \"unexpected_message\" alert.

### 4. Example Two PROCESSING
#### Input:
***
--- Section: 4.1.3.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Server Hello ---
The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello message to proceed with the handshake if it is able to negotiate an acceptable set of handshake parameters based on the ClientHello.

Structure of this message:

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303;    /* TLS v1.2 */
          Random random;
          opaque legacy_session_id_echo<0..32>;
          CipherSuite cipher_suite;
          uint8 legacy_compression_method = 0;
          Extension extensions<6..2^16-1>;
      } ServerHello;

   legacy_version:  In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for version negotiation and represented the selected version number for the connection.  Unfortunately, some middleboxes fail when presented with new values.  In TLS 1.3, the TLS server indicates its version using the "supported_versions" extension (Section 4.2.1), and the legacy_version field MUST be set to 0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2.  (See Appendix D for details about backward compatibility.)

   random:  32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.  See Appendix C for additional information.  The last 8 bytes MUST be overwritten as described below if negotiating TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1, but the remaining bytes MUST be random.  This structure is generated by the server and MUST be generated independently of the ClientHello.random.

   legacy_session_id_echo:  The contents of the client's legacy_session_id field.  Note that this field is echoed even if the client's value corresponded to a cached pre-TLS 1.3 session which the server has chosen not to resume.  A client which receives a legacy_session_id_echo field that does not match what it sent in the ClientHello MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   cipher_suite:  The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   legacy_compression_method:  A single byte which MUST have the value 0.

   extensions:  A list of extensions.  The ServerHello MUST only include extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic context and negotiate the protocol version.  All TLS 1.3 ServerHello messages MUST contain the "supported_versions" extension.  Current ServerHello messages additionally contain either the "pre_shared_key" extension or the "key_share" extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment).  Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent separately in the EncryptedExtensions message.

   For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure as the ServerHello, but with Random set to the special value of the SHA-256 of "HelloRetryRequest":

     CF 21 AD 74 E5 9A 61 11 BE 1D 8C 02 1E 65 B8 91
     C2 A2 11 16 7A BB 8C 5E 07 9E 09 E2 C8 A8 33 9C

   Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process it as described in Section 4.1.4).

   TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's random value.  TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value specially in their ServerHello.

   If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value to the bytes:

     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01

   If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2 servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random value to the bytes:

     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00

   TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these values.  TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or below.  If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.  This mechanism provides limited protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange, a message present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are used.  It does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA is used.

   Note: This is a change from [RFC5246], so in practice many TLS 1.2 clients and servers will not behave as specified above.

   A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST abort the handshake with a "protocol_version" alert.  Note that renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.

# Expert Natural Language Processing AI

## Expertise
- Precise and rapid text segmentation
- Semantic analysis
- Topic extraction
- Code-to-narrative conversion

## Task: Advanced Text Segmentation and Analysis 

### Instructions
As an expert in natural language processing, analyze the provided text with precision and efficiency:

1. Code and Pseudo-code Identification Rules:
   - Identify and remove all code-like structures including:
     * enum {...} declarations
     * struct {...} definitions 
     * Type definitions
     * Variable declarations
     * Code comments (/* ... */)
     * Hexadecimal values when part of code structures
     * Byte-level specifications when part of code structures
   - Exception: Keep hexadecimal values and byte specifications when they are part of semantic descriptions of protocol behaviors

2. Text Segmentation Rules:
   - Each segment must be completely self-contained without requiring external context
   - All pronouns (these, that, it, etc.) and their referents must be within the same segment
   - All demonstratives (this, these values, etc.) and their referred content must be within the same segment 
   - Values and their verification requirements must be kept together in the same segment
   - Segments must preserve the exact case (uppercase/lowercase) from the original text
   - Segments must be exact substrings of the input text, with no rewording or modification
   - When splitting sentences, ensure all related context needed for comprehension stays together
   
3. Reference Resolution Requirements:
   - Track all pronouns and their antecedents
   - Track all demonstratives and their referred content
   - Track all mechanism descriptions and their corresponding verification steps
   - Keep referring expressions with their referents in the same segment
   - Maintain contextual information needed to resolve references
   - Preserve technical term definitions with their usage
   
4. Process Steps:
   - First pass: Remove all code and pseudo-code sections following the identification rules
   - Second pass: Identify minimal but complete semantic units following these guidelines:
     * Mechanism descriptions must include their verification steps
     * Values must include their validation requirements
     * Security checks must include the conditions being checked
     * Error handling must include the conditions triggering the errors
   - Verify reference resolution within each unit
   - Confirm segment independence
   - Assign accurate topic labels
   - Execute five independent analyses
   - Select most consistent result

5. Quality Checks:
   - Verify each segment is an exact substring of input
   - Confirm no code or pseudo-code structures remain in output
   - Confirm all references (pronouns, demonstratives, values) have clear antecedents
   - Validate all mechanisms are described with their verification steps
   - Validate technical term continuity
   - Check case sensitivity preservation
   - Ensure no contextual dependencies between segments

### Output Format
{section title}[Topic]{Content}

- Topic labels should be concise but descriptive
- Content must be verbatim from input text
- Maintain original document structure and sequence
- Preserve all technical accuracy
- Exclude all code and pseudo-code structures

### Key Features Demonstrated:
1. Code structures completely removed
2. Natural language content preserved
3. Semantic completeness maintained
4. Technical accuracy preserved
5. References resolved within segments

A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.
{Section: 4.1.3.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Server Hello}[Extensions Requirements]{A list of extensions. The ServerHello MUST only include extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic context and negotiate the protocol version. All TLS 1.3 ServerHello messages MUST contain the "supported_versions" extension. Current ServerHello messages additionally contain either the "pre_shared_key" extension or the "key_share" extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment). Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent separately in the EncryptedExtensions message.}
{Section: 4.1.3.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Server Hello}[HelloRetryRequest Special Case]{For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure as the ServerHello, but with Random set to the special value of the SHA-256 of "HelloRetryRequest": CF 21 AD 74 E5 9A 61 11 BE 1D 8C 02 1E 65 B8 91 C2 A2 11 16 7A BB 8C 5E 07 9E 09 E2 C8 A8 33 9C Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process it as described in Section 4.1.4).}
{Section: 4.1.3.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Server Hello}[Downgrade Protection Mechanism and Verification]{TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's random value. TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value specially in their ServerHello. If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value to the bytes: 44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01 If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2 servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random value to the bytes: 44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00 TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these values. TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or below. If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert. This mechanism provides limited protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange, a message present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are used. It does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA is used.}
{Section: 4.1.3.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Server Hello}[Legacy Client Renegotiation]{A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST abort the handshake with a "protocol_version" alert. Note that renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.}
