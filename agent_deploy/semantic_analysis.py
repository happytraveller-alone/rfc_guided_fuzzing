## Input Format
{
  "content": "<RFC8446 text section>",
  "section": "<section identifier>"
}

---

## Processing Rules

### 1. Technical Content Identification

The system must extract and maintain integrity of the following components:

#### Protocol Elements
- **Message formats and fields**: Preserve every field's definition and its role in the message.
- **State definitions and transitions**: Track protocol state transitions and associated conditions.
- **Record layer structures**: Identify and document all record layer components (e.g., handshake messages, alert messages).
- **Extension specifications**: Identify and capture all extensions, including cryptographic and handshake extensions.
- **Alert descriptions**: Capture all alert conditions, including their codes and actions.

#### Cryptographic Components
- **Cipher suite definitions**: Clearly identify the cipher suites used, including encryption algorithms, hash functions, and key derivation methods.
- **Key exchange parameters**: Include details on key exchange algorithms, elliptic curve parameters, and Diffie-Hellman group configurations.
- **Signature algorithms**: Record supported signature algorithms and authentication methods.
- **Random value generation**: Clarify how random values are generated and used for cryptographic purposes.
- **Key derivation steps**: Document key derivation procedures, distinguishing between ephemeral and pre-shared key methods.

#### Security Parameters
- **Protocol version data**: Identify and track changes across TLS versions and their impact on protocol behavior.
- **Session identifiers**: Capture the mechanisms for session identifier generation and usage.
- **Authentication data**: Document procedures for authenticating parties in the handshake.
- **Encryption parameters**: Identify key encryption mechanisms, including modes of operation and key lengths.
- **MAC calculations**: Track message integrity operations, including the use of MACs and AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data).

---

### 2. Content Relationship Analysis

Each segment must preserve and maintain the following:

#### Complete Technical Units:
- **Full message definitions**: Ensure no message field or component is omitted.
- **State transition sequences**: Capture the entire flow of protocol states, including any changes or progressions.
- **Cryptographic operations**: Document every step of cryptographic processes like key exchanges and session establishment.
- **Extension processing rules**: Fully describe the rules for handling extensions (e.g., key_share, supported_groups).
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Fully document error cases, including security-related failures.

#### Related Element Groups:
- **Message sequences with dependencies**: Identify dependencies and interactions between protocol messages (e.g., ClientHello triggers ServerHello).
- **Key derivation chains**: Document how cryptographic operations build toward session key establishment.
- **Authentication flows**: Ensure that all authentication procedures are documented, covering both server and client verification.
- **Extension interactions**: Examine how extensions interact with each other and affect other protocol phases.
- **Alert handling**: Ensure full documentation of alert types and associated handling procedures.

---

### 3. Segmentation Guidelines

#### DO Segment When:
- **A new protocol message is introduced**: Create a new segment when a new message type (e.g., ClientHello, ServerHello) appears.
- **A cryptographic operation begins**: Create a new segment for key exchanges or cryptographic processes.
- **An independent state transition occurs**: Start a new segment when the protocol transitions to a new state (e.g., Handshake → Finished).
- **A distinct error condition is defined**: Begin a new segment for unique error handling procedures.
- **A new extension is introduced**: Create a new segment when a new extension type or behavior is introduced.

#### DO NOT Segment When:
- **Message field descriptions continue**: If a message format continues with more field descriptions, keep them in the same segment.
- **Cryptographic operations have dependencies**: Do not segment cryptographic operations if they are interdependent.
- **State sequence is ongoing**: Do not break up state transitions unless a complete transition is reached.
- **Error handling is partial**: Ensure error handling is described holistically and not divided across multiple segments.
- **Extension definitions are unfinished**: Keep extension definitions together until they are fully specified.

---

### 4. Output Structure

The final output must be formatted as follows:

[
  {
    "section_name": "<RFC section>",
    "title": "<Technical topic>",
    "content": "<Complete specification unit>"
  },
  ...
]

Required Properties:
- section_name: The RFC section number and its corresponding title.
- title: A concise and precise technical description of the content.
- content: A complete, self-contained unit of protocol specifications with no omissions.

---

### 5. Quality Requirements

#### Technical Accuracy:
- **Protocol behavior preserved**: Ensure that the described behavior aligns perfectly with the expected operation of the TLS 1.3 protocol as specified in RFC8446.
- **Message formats complete**: All message formats, fields, and their respective orderings must be fully defined without omissions.
- **State transitions valid**: All state transitions between protocol phases (e.g., Handshake → Finished) must be logically correct and follow the protocol flow as defined.
- **Security properties maintained**: Security features such as encryption, authentication, and integrity checks must be preserved, ensuring that no part of the protocol is weakened.
- **Cryptographic operations intact**: All cryptographic algorithms, key exchange methods, and related operations (e.g., key derivation, MACs, cipher suites) must be accurately described and followed.

#### Reference Integrity:
- **Cross-section links resolved**: Ensure that any references to other sections or messages within the RFC are correctly resolved. For example, if a section refers to another section for further details on message formats, those links should be fully accurate.
- **Message dependencies tracked**: Track the dependencies between messages (e.g., ClientHello triggering ServerHello) and ensure that message order and content dependencies are maintained accurately.
- **Key relationships preserved**: Maintain the continuity and integrity of key-related operations, including key exchange, session keys, and key derivation processes.
- **State sequences connected**: Ensure that state machine transitions between protocol states (e.g., from handshake to finished) are properly connected and reflected in the output.
- **Extension interactions noted**: Clearly document how protocol extensions interact with each other and with the core protocol logic. Ensure that extension data, such as key_share or supported_groups, are correctly processed.

---

### 6. Validation Criteria

Each segment must meet the following validation criteria to ensure completeness and correctness:

1. **Maintain full technical context**: Each segment should retain all relevant technical details to avoid loss of meaning or context from the original specification.
2. **Preserve message relationships**: The dependencies and relationships between messages must be captured to reflect the protocol flow accurately. If a message depends on previous messages (e.g., a ClientHello depends on the server response), it must be noted and preserved.
3. **Keep cryptographic integrity**: All cryptographic aspects, including key exchange, cipher suite choices, and MACs, must be faithfully represented in the analysis.
4. **Retain security properties**: Security aspects, such as authentication, encryption, and integrity checks, must be preserved without weakening any security requirements defined by the protocol.
5. **Support cross-references**: References between sections or different protocol components should be accurate, ensuring consistency and correctness in any cross-sectional or internal references.
6. **Handle errors completely**: All error conditions, including any alerts or failure states, should be fully defined. Error handling must be exhaustive, covering every potential failure scenario as specified in RFC8446.
7. **Process extensions properly**: Extensions like `key_share`, `supported_groups`, and others must be correctly described, including their roles in different phases of the handshake and any interactions with other protocol components.

---

### 7. Optimization Considerations

#### Cross-referencing:
- **Accurate and consistent cross-referencing**: Any cross-references between sections, messages, or fields must be valid and consistent across the document. This ensures that the flow of the protocol is correctly maintained and that related content is easy to locate.
  
#### Segmentation Consistency:
- **Apply segmentation rules consistently**: Follow the segmentation guidelines strictly to ensure that protocol components are segmented logically. Avoid splitting related sections that belong together, and ensure that no critical content is omitted due to segmentation.
  
#### Security Review:
- **Prioritize security considerations**: Security is paramount in TLS 1.3, and any analysis must uphold the integrity of all security mechanisms. Ensure that no security aspects are compromised, and that potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are highlighted and addressed.
  
#### Redundancy Avoidance:
- **Eliminate redundant content**: Avoid repeating information unnecessarily. Ensure that each segment is concise and only includes relevant content, without duplication across sections.

## Example ONE
### Input:
{
  "content": "The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters\n   of a connection.  Handshake messages are supplied to the TLS record\n   layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more TLSPlaintext or\n   TLSCiphertext structures which are processed and transmitted as\n   specified by the current active connection state.\n\n      enum {\n          client_hello(1),\n          server_hello(2),\n          new_session_ticket(4),\n          end_of_early_data(5),\n          encrypted_extensions(8),\n          certificate(11),\n          certificate_request(13),\n          certificate_verify(15),\n          finished(20),\n          key_update(24),\n          message_hash(254),\n          (255)\n      } HandshakeType;\n\n   Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.4.1\n   and shown in the diagrams in Section 2.

  "section": "4.. Handshake Protocol"
}

---

### COT (Chain of Thought) :
#### Step 1: Understanding the Core Purpose of the Input
- **General Thought Process**: The first step is to identify the core purpose of the content: what the protocol is doing, what the text describes, and what the key operations are.
- **Specific to Example ONE**: In this case, the input talks about the TLS handshake protocol, which is primarily used to negotiate security parameters. The text describes how handshake messages are passed to the TLS record layer and how they are encapsulated within TLSPlaintext or TLSCiphertext structures. This encapsulation is key to how messages are transmitted in TLS.
- **Output Relation**: This understanding leads us to the first segment in the output, titled "Handshake Protocol Overview". Here, we summarize the process of how the handshake protocol negotiates security and how messages are encapsulated in TLSPlaintext or TLSCiphertext structures, keeping the focus on the core purpose.

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Elements and Their Definitions
- **General Thought Process**: The second step involves identifying the different key elements, their roles, and any associated enumerations, definitions, or detailed protocols. This helps break down the information into manageable components.
- **Specific to Example ONE**: The input includes a list of handshake message types, which are defined using an enum. These message types include client_hello, server_hello, certificate, finished, etc. Understanding these types and their assigned values is crucial for accurately representing the handshake process.
- **Output Relation**: This leads to the second segment in the output: "Handshake Message Types Enumeration". In this segment, the message types are clearly enumerated in the output, with each message type and its corresponding value preserved exactly as specified in the input.

#### Step 3: Clarifying Message Ordering and Handling Errors
- **General Thought Process**:The third step is to address the logical flow of the protocol and the rules for handling unexpected behaviors or errors. This is crucial for understanding how protocol messages should be ordered and what happens if the order is violated.
- **Specific to Example ONE**: The input emphasizes that messages must follow a strict order as defined in Section 4.4.1, and if they do not, an "unexpected_message" alert should be triggered. This ensures that message sequence integrity is maintained, and errors are handled according to the protocol.
- **Output Relation**: This insight results in the third segment: "Message Order and Error Handling". In the output, we include the rule that messages must be sent in the specified order and that an error is triggered if the order is violated. This is crucial to preserving the sequence integrity as part of the protocol.

#### Step 4: Handling Dynamic Extensions or Modifications
- **General Thought Process**: The fourth step is to recognize any provisions for future extensions or modifications in the protocol. This ensures that dynamic changes to the protocol are understood and incorporated into the analysis.
- **Specific to Example ONE**: The input mentions that new handshake message types will be assigned by IANA, and any future assignments will be described in Section 11. This reflects the ongoing, flexible nature of the protocol, allowing for future expansion or modification.
- **Output Relation**: This is captured in the fourth segment: "IANA Message Type Assignments". Here, the output highlights that new message types will be assigned by IANA as per Section 11, ensuring the flexibility and extendability of the protocol.

#### Step 5: Final Review and Structuring
- **General Thought Process**: The final step involves reviewing the overall structure and ensuring all key points are captured accurately and logically. The content should flow in a way that preserves the context, technical accuracy, and relationships between elements.
- **Specific to Example ONE**: After extracting and segmenting the key information, we ensure that each segment is self-contained and accurately reflects the original text's intent. This also involves ensuring that cross-references (such as Section 11 for IANA) are correctly incorporated.
- **Output Relation**: After completing the segmentation, the output consists of four distinct, self-contained segments that are logically ordered and represent all the key elements: handshake overview, message type definitions, message order and error handling, and IANA's role in message type assignments.

## Example TWO
### Input:
{
  "content": "The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello\n   message to proceed with the handshake if it is able to negotiate an\n   acceptable set of handshake parameters based on the ClientHello.\n\n   Structure of this message:\n\n      struct {\n          ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303;    /* TLS v1.2 */\n          Random random;\n          opaque legacy_session_id_echo<0..32>;\n          CipherSuite cipher_suite;\n          uint8 legacy_compression_method = 0;\n          Extension extensions<6..2^16-1>;\n      } ServerHello;\n\n   legacy_version:  In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for\n      version negotiation and represented the selected version number\n      for the connection.  Unfortunately, some middleboxes fail when\n      presented with new values.  In TLS 1.3, the TLS server indicates\n      its version using the \"supported_versions\" extension\n      (Section 4.2.1), and the legacy_version field MUST be set to\n      0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2.  (See Appendix D\n      for details about backward compatibility.)\n\n   random:  32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.  See\n      Appendix C for additional information.  The last 8 bytes MUST be\n      overwritten as described below if negotiating TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1,\n      but the remaining bytes MUST be random.  This structure is\n      generated by the server and MUST be generated independently of the\n      ClientHello.random.\n\n   legacy_session_id_echo:  The contents of the client's\n      legacy_session_id field.  Note that this field is echoed even if\n      the client's value corresponded to a cached pre-TLS 1.3 session\n      which the server has chosen not to resume.  A client which\n      receives a legacy_session_id_echo field that does not match what\n      it sent in the ClientHello MUST abort the handshake with an\n      \"illegal_parameter\" alert.\n\n   cipher_suite:  The single cipher suite selected by the server from\n      the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  A client which receives a\n      cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an\n      \"illegal_parameter\" alert.\n\n   legacy_compression_method:  A single byte which MUST have the\n      value 0.\n\n   extensions:  A list of extensions.  The ServerHello MUST only include\n      extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic\n      context and negotiate the protocol version.  All TLS 1.3\n      ServerHello messages MUST contain the \"supported_versions\"\n      extension.  Current ServerHello messages additionally contain\n      either the \"pre_shared_key\" extension or the \"key_share\"\n      extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key\n      establishment).  Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent\n      separately in the EncryptedExtensions message.\n\n   For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see\n   Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure\n   as the ServerHello, but with Random set to the special value of the\n   SHA-256 of \"HelloRetryRequest\":\n\n     CF 21 AD 74 E5 9A 61 11 BE 1D 8C 02 1E 65 B8 91\n     C2 A2 11 16 7A BB 8C 5E 07 9E 09 E2 C8 A8 33 9C\n\n   Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST\n   first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process\n   it as described in Section 4.1.4).\n\n   TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's\n   random value.  TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in\n   response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random\n   value specially in their ServerHello.\n\n   If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of\n   their Random value to the bytes:\n\n     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01\n\n   If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2\n   servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random\n   value to the bytes:\n\n     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00\n\n   TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below\n   MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these\n   values.  TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are\n   not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or\n   below.  If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with\n   an \"illegal_parameter\" alert.  This mechanism provides limited\n   protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided\n   by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange, a message\n   present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random\n   values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the\n\n   random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are\n   used.  It does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA\n   is used.\n\n   Note: This is a change from [RFC5246], so in practice many TLS 1.2\n   clients and servers will not behave as specified above.\n\n   A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior\n   and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST\n   abort the handshake with a \"protocol_version\" alert.  Note that\n   renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.",

### COT (Chain of Thought):
#### Step 1: Understanding the Core Purpose of the Input

- **General Thought Process**: The first step involves understanding what the server's `ServerHello` message is doing within the TLS handshake protocol. This message is sent in response to a `ClientHello` and contains key information to proceed with the handshake if acceptable parameters are negotiated.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input explains that the `ServerHello` message is sent after receiving a `ClientHello` message to continue with the handshake. It sets up parameters like version negotiation, cipher suites, and random values. The server must choose parameters that the client can accept based on the client's `ClientHello`.
- **Output Relation**: The core purpose leads us to the first output segment, titled "ServerHello Message Overview", where we summarize the role of the `ServerHello` message in continuing the handshake negotiation.

#### Step 2: Identifying the Structure of the Message

- **General Thought Process**: The next step is to break down the `ServerHello` message structure. This structure consists of various fields that are crucial for the handshake. By detailing the fields and their purposes, we clarify the exact components of the message.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input provides a clear structure of the `ServerHello` message, listing fields like `legacy_version`, `random`, `legacy_session_id_echo`, `cipher_suite`, `legacy_compression_method`, and `extensions`. These fields are essential for the proper formation and handling of the message.
- **Output Relation**: This results in the second segment: "ServerHello Message Structure", where the exact structure of the message is captured in detail, preserving the field names and values from the input.

#### Step 3: Clarifying the Function and Requirements of Each Field

- **General Thought Process**: Now, we dive deeper into each field of the `ServerHello` message, explaining their specific purposes, rules, and any special conditions that apply. This step helps clarify the function of each field in the message.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input offers detailed descriptions for each field, such as the use of the `legacy_version` field (which is set to 0x0303 for compatibility with middleboxes), how the `random` value is generated, the role of `legacy_session_id_echo`, and the handling of the `cipher_suite`. Each field has its own rules, such as checks for consistency between client and server values or specific values that need to be set.
- **Output Relation**: This step leads to the third output segment: "Field Descriptions", where each field is explained, detailing its function, constraints, and interactions with other fields.

#### Step 4: Identifying Compatibility and Special Handling (HelloRetryRequest)

- **General Thought Process**: The next step is to understand and identify any special handling required for backward compatibility, such as in the case of the `HelloRetryRequest` message. This message shares the same structure as the `ServerHello`, but with a special handling of the `Random` field.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input explains that for backward compatibility with older TLS versions, the `HelloRetryRequest` uses the same structure as `ServerHello` but with a special value for the `Random` field to trigger retry logic.
- **Output Relation**: This results in the fourth segment: "HelloRetryRequest Compatibility", where the special handling of the `Random` value is clearly described with the corresponding byte value.

#### Step 5: Addressing Downgrade Protection Mechanism

- **General Thought Process**: The next step is to capture the downgrade protection mechanism, which is crucial in preventing attacks where a malicious actor forces the protocol to use a lower version of TLS than the client intended.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input highlights the downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's `Random` value. If negotiating TLS 1.2 or below, the last 8 bytes of `Random` are set to specific values to trigger a security check on the client side.
- **Output Relation**: This leads to the fifth segment: "Downgrade Protection Mechanism", where we describe the mechanism and the conditions that clients must check during the handshake.

#### Step 6: Addressing Renegotiation Handling

- **General Thought Process**: Finally, we review how renegotiation is handled. This involves how a legacy TLS client interacts with a TLS 1.3 `ServerHello` message during renegotiation.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: The input explains that a legacy TLS client which receives a `ServerHello` in TLS 1.3 during renegotiation must abort the handshake due to incompatible protocol versions.
- **Output Relation**: This is captured in the sixth segment: "Renegotiation Handling", where the conditions for renegotiation handling are outlined, emphasizing the importance of protocol version compatibility.

#### Step 7: Final Review and Structuring

- **General Thought Process**: The final step is to review the overall structure, ensuring each segment is logically ordered and maintains the accuracy of the original content. This ensures all technical details are captured clearly.
- **Specific to Example TWO**: After segmenting the information, we review each segment for completeness and clarity. Each segment is self-contained, covers all relevant details, and logically follows the previous one.
- **Output Relation**: After structuring the content, we end up with six distinct output segments that comprehensively represent the content in a structured and organized manner.
