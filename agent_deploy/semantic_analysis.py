## INPUT FORMAT
{
  "content": "<rfc8446 document natural language description>",
  "section": "<section name>"
}

## Detailed Processing Instructions

- Random values
- Session IDs
- PRF outputs
- MAC keys
- Encryption keys

#### Protocol Constants
- Magic values
- Fixed lengths
- Field sizes
- Time limits
- Retry counts
- Extension codes

### 2. Document Analysis Rules

#### Technical Pattern Recognition
MUST detect and preserve:
- Message definitions
- State transitions
- Error conditions
- Extension points
- Version negotiation
- Downgrade protection

#### Context Boundaries
MUST maintain cohesion between:
- Handshake messages
- Key derivation steps
- Authentication sequences
- Extension processing
- Alert handling
- State updates

#### Reference Mapping
MUST track and resolve:
- Section references
- Message dependencies
- Key relationships
- State prerequisites
- Extension requirements
- Error conditions

### 2.5. Content Relationship Rules

#### Pattern Recognition & Grouping
MUST identify and maintain as cohesive units:

##### Enumeration Patterns
When document structure shows:
- Overview statement listing N items/options
- Followed by detailed explanations of each item/option
MUST combine into single segment maintaining hierarchy:
[
  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic_one>,
    "content": <content_block with full detailes>
  },
  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic_two>,
    "content": <content_block with full detailes>
  },
  ...
]

##### Definition Patterns
When content presents:
- Structure/type definition
- Field-by-field explanations
MUST group as single segment:
[
  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic_complete structure definition_one>,
    "content": <content_block with full detailes>
  },
  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic_complete structure definition_two>,
    "content": <content_block with full detailes>
  },
  ...
]

##### Related Concept Groups
MUST keep together:
- Overview statements with their expansions
- Lists with their complete descriptions
- Protocol options with their specifications
- Requirements with their conditions
- Exceptions with their handling rules

#### DO NOT Split Content When
- An overview introduces items to be detailed
- A numbered/bulleted list continues with explanations
- A structure definition is followed by field descriptions
- A protocol option lists and details sub-options
- Security requirements enumerate multiple conditions

#### DO Split Content When
- Topic changes completely
- New independent protocol behavior starts
- Unrelated security consideration begins
- Different message type is introduced
- Separate error scenario is described

### 3. Segmentation Requirements

#### Independent Completeness
Each segment MUST:
- Stand alone technically
- Include full context
- Preserve protocol logic
- Maintain security properties
- Keep cryptographic relationships

#### Technical Integrity
MUST preserve:
- Message sequences
- State machine logic
- Key derivation steps
- Authentication chains
- Extension processing
- Error handling

#### Reference Resolution  
MUST maintain:
- Cross-section links
- Protocol dependencies
- Security requirements
- Version compatibility
- Extension interactions

### 4. Output Format

#### Structure Template

  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic>,
    "content": <content_block>
  },
  {
    "section_name": <rfc8446_section>,
    "title": <tls13_topic>,
    "content": <content_block>
  },
  ...
]

Where:
- rfc8446_section = Original RFC section number

Unfortunately, some middleboxes fail when\n      presented with new values.  In TLS 1.3, the TLS server indicates\n      its version using the \"supported_versions\" extension\n      (Section 4.2.1), and the legacy_version field MUST be set to\n      0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2.  (See Appendix D\n      for details about backward compatibility.)\n\n   random:  32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.  See\n      Appendix C for additional information.  The last 8 bytes MUST be\n      overwritten as described below if negotiating TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1,\n      but the remaining bytes MUST be random.  This structure is\n      generated by the server and MUST be generated independently of the\n      ClientHello.random.\n\n   legacy_session_id_echo:  The contents of the client's\n      legacy_session_id field.  Note that this field is echoed even if\n      the client's value corresponded to a cached pre-TLS 1.3 session\n      which the server has chosen not to resume.  A client which\n      receives a legacy_session_id_echo field that does not match what\n      it sent in the ClientHello MUST abort the handshake with an\n      \"illegal_parameter\" alert.\n\n   cipher_suite:  The single cipher suite selected by the server from\n      the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  A client which receives a\n      cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an\n      \"illegal_parameter\" alert.\n\n   legacy_compression_method:  A single byte which MUST have the\n      value 0.\n\n   extensions:  A list of extensions.  The ServerHello MUST only include\n      extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic\n      context and negotiate the protocol version.  All TLS 1.3\n      ServerHello messages MUST contain the \"supported_versions\"\n      extension.  Current ServerHello messages additionally contain\n      either the \"pre_shared_key\" extension or the \"key_share\"\n      extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key\n      establishment).  Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent\n      separately in the EncryptedExtensions message.\n\n   For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see\n   Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure\n   as the ServerHello, but with Random set to the special value of the\n   SHA-256 of \"HelloRetryRequest\":\n\n     CF 21 AD 74 E5 9A 61 11 BE 1D 8C 02 1E 65 B8 91\n     C2 A2 11 16 7A BB 8C 5E 07 9E 09 E2 C8 A8 33 9C\n\n   Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST\n   first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process\n   it as described in Section 4.1.4).\n\n   TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's\n   random value.  TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in\n   response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random\n   value specially in their ServerHello.\n\n   If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of\n   their Random value to the bytes:\n\n     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01\n\n   If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2\n   servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random\n   value to the bytes:\n\n     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00\n\n   TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below\n   MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these\n   values.  TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are\n   not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or\n   below.  If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with\n   an \"illegal_parameter\" alert.  This mechanism provides limited\n   protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided\n   by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange, a message\n   present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random\n   values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the\n\n   random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are\n   used.  It does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA\n   is used.\n\n   Note: This is a change from [RFC5246], so in practice many TLS 1.2\n   clients and servers will not behave as specified above.\n\n   A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior\n   and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST\n   abort the handshake with a \"protocol_version\" alert.  Note that\n   renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.",
