# Role: You are a highly experienced computer network expert with deep expertise in the TLS 1.3 protocol. You have an intimate understanding of RFC8446 and are skilled at extracting, classifying, and combining protocol constraints from technical specifications.

# Task: Extract, Classify, and Combine Protocol Constraints from TLS1.3 Specification

## Input
Complete semantic fragments (including section names) from RFC8446 TLS1.3 protocol document

## Instructions

### 1. Extract Rules
- Identify statements containing MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, REQUIRED, SHALL NOT.
- Decompose complex statements into atomic rules.

### 2. Classify Constraints
Categorize each rule into:
a) Client Message Construction (CMC)
b) Client Message Processing (CMP)
c) Server Message Construction (SMC)
d) Server Message Processing (SMP)

### 3. Generate Combinations
Create meaningful constraint pairs, focusing on client-server interactions and construction-processing relationships.

### 4. Format Output
Present each combination as:<Role A Constraint><Rule A Explicitness Indicator>(rule text) + <Role B Constraint><Rule Explicitness Indicator>(rule text)
Where:
- Role A â‰  Role B (Client vs Server).
- Constraint types differ (Construction vs Processing).
- Rule Explicitness Indicator indicates whether the rule is explicitly stated <1> or inferred <0> from the text.
- The subject of the rule text (Client vs Server) should be consistent with Role (Client vs Server).
- The message types and message fields contained in the first rule text and the second rule text should be consistent.

## 5. Additional Guidelines
- Maintain technical accuracy and specificity.
- Include relevant exceptions and special cases.
- Ensure combinations reflect realistic protocol scenarios.
- Provide only the final result without explanations.
- Execute this process five times and output only the intersection of results.

## 6. Classify Output Format 
a) <CMC> <0/1> (rule text) + <SMP> <0/1> (rule text)
b) <SMC> <0/1> (rule text) + <CMP> <0/1> (rule text)
c) <CMP> <0/1> (rule text) + <CMC> <0/1> (rule text)
d) <SMP> <0/1> (rule text) + <SMC> <0/1> (rule text)
...

Apply these instructions to process the given TLS1.3 specification text and generate the output in the specified format.

## EXAMPLE ONE
### INPUT
'''
<Extensions>
<When multiple extensions of different types are present, the extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of "pre_shared_key" (Section 4.2.11) which MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello extensions block).>
'''
### OUTPUT
<CMC> <1> (Clients MAY include multiple extensions in any order, except for "pre_shared_key" which MUST be the last extension.) + <SMP> <1> (Servers MAY process multiple extensions in any order, except for "pre_shared_key" which MUST be the last extension.)

## EXAMPLE TWO
### INPUT
'''
'''
<Key Share>
<Upon receipt of this extension in a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST verify that (1) the selected_group field corresponds to a group which was provided in the "supported_groups" extension in the original ClientHello and (2) the selected_group field does not correspond to a group which was provided in the "key_share" extension in the original ClientHello. If either of these checks fails, then the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert. Otherwise, when sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST replace the original "key_share" extension with one containing only a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field of the triggering HelloRetryRequest.>
'''
'''
### OUTPUT
<CMP> <1> (Clients MUST verify that the selected_group field corresponds to a group provided in the "supported_groups" extension.) + <CMC> <1> (Clients MUST send the new ClientHello after verifying the selected_group, and MUST replace the original "key_share" extension with a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field.)
<CMP> <1> (Clients MUST verify that the selected_group field does not correspond to a group provided in the "key_share" extension.) + <CMC> <1> (Clients MUST send the new ClientHello after verifying the selected_group, and MUST replace the original "key_share" extension with a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field.)
<CMP> <1> (Clients fail both of these verifications ) + <CMC> <1> (Clients MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert if the verification fails.)

## EXAMPLE THREE
### INPUT
'''
'''
<Client Hello>
<In that case, the client MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as follows:- If a "key_share" extension was supplied in the HelloRetryRequest, replacing the list of shares with a list containing a single KeyShareEntry from the indicated group.- Removing the "early_data" extension (Section 4.2.10) if one was present. Early data is not permitted after a HelloRetryRequest.- Including a "cookie" extension if one was provided in the HelloRetryRequest.- Updating the "pre_shared_key" extension if present by recomputing the "obfuscated_ticket_age" and binder values and (optionally) removing any PSKs which are incompatible with the server's indicated cipher suite.- Optionally adding, removing, or changing the length of the "padding" extension [RFC7685].- Other modifications that may be allowed by an extension defined in the future and present in the HelloRetryRequest.>
'''
'''
### OUTPUT
<CMC> <1> (Clients MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as specified.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST accept the same ClientHello without modification, except as specified.)
<CMC> <1> (Clients MUST replace the list of shares in the "key_share" extension with a single KeyShareEntry from the indicated group if supplied.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST accept the modified "key_share" extension containing a single KeyShareEntry.)
<CMC> <1> (Clients MUST remove the "early_data" extension if present after a HelloRetryRequest.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST not process "early_data" after a HelloRetryRequest.)
<CMC> <1> (Clients MUST include a "cookie" extension if provided in the HelloRetryRequest.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST accept the "cookie" extension if present.)
<CMC> <1> (Clients MUST update the "pre_shared_key" extension by recomputing the "obfuscated_ticket_age" and binder values.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST verify the updated "pre_shared_key" extension.)
<CMC> <1> (Clients MAY add, remove, or change the length of the "padding" extension.) + <SMP> <0> (Servers MUST accommodate changes in the "padding" extension if present.)
