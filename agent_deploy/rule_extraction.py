---

### Verification Process
1. **Initial Rule Extraction**: Extract primary, secondary, and tertiary rules from the input text, ensuring that all constraints are identified.
2. **Technical Review**: Validate that the extracted rules strictly comply with **RFC8446** and its specific guidelines.
3. **Security Analysis**: Evaluate if the rules uphold TLS 1.3’s security goals, particularly around authentication, encryption, and data integrity.
4. **Completeness Check**: Verify that all relevant details, including implicit constraints and edge cases, are captured in the output.
5. **Consistency Validation**: Ensure that extracted rules logically fit together, are internally consistent, and align with the intended message flow.
6. **Implementation Feasibility**: Ensure that the rules are practically implementable, respecting the constraints of real-world systems and their processing capabilities.

---

### Common Pitfall Prevention

1. **Avoid Version Mixing**: Ensure that the rules extracted pertain strictly to the current version of the TLS protocol, in this case, TLS 1.3 (RFC8446), avoiding mixing with previous versions' behavior.
2. **Context Preservation**: Always ensure that the protocol context is understood properly to avoid misinterpretation. Contextual factors like handshake order, state transitions, and protocol phase identification must be factored into rule extraction.
3. **Security Requirements Compliance**: Always prioritize preserving TLS 1.3's security principles. Do not introduce rules that weaken encryption, authentication, or data integrity requirements.
4. **Message Sequencing**: Ensure that the message flow, including request-response pairs and message exchanges, is respected and follows the sequence defined in RFC8446.
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Include rules for handling edge cases, unexpected messages, and error conditions. This ensures that any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can be handled appropriately.

---

### Process Iteration
1. **Initial Rule Extraction**: Parse the input section and extract relevant protocol rules.
2. **Refinement**: Improve the extracted rules by cross-referencing and adjusting based on RFC8446 and previous analyses.
3. **Validation**: Ensure the rules are valid, consistent, and aligned with TLS 1.3 specifications.
4. **Security Review**: Re-examine the extracted rules from a security perspective to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced.
5. **Final Verification**: Complete a final check to ensure that the output is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly.

Output only the intersection of all iterations for optimal results.


## EXAMPLE ONE
### INPUT
{
  "Section": "4.2.. Handshake Protocol_Extensions",
  "Title": "Extension Order and Duplication",
  "Content": "When multiple extensions of different types are present, the extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of \"pre_shared_key\" which MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello extensions block). There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in a given extension block."
}

---

### Thought Process for COT (Chain of Thought) Analysis:

#### Step 1: Protocol Phase Identification
- **Section**: "4.2. Handshake Protocol_Extensions"
- This section pertains to the Handshake phase of the TLS protocol, which is the first major phase of TLS after the initial connection establishment. It governs the exchange of parameters, including extensions, between the client and server.

#### Step 2: Message Flow Context
- **Message Sequence**: This content concerns the ordering and duplication of extensions in the ClientHello and ServerHello messages, which are part of the handshake process.
- **State Requirements**: The "ClientHello" is sent first by the client, and the "ServerHello" follows from the server. The rules specify how extensions should be placed in these messages, focusing on "pre_shared_key" and ensuring no duplicate extensions.

#### Step 3: Security Context
- The security context is critical here, as the "pre_shared_key" extension impacts the security of the handshake. If the client includes this extension out of order or with duplicates, it could create issues during the establishment of a secure session.

#### Step 4: Rule Extraction
1. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: The "pre_shared_key" extension **MUST** be the last extension in the ClientHello.
2. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: Other extensions **MAY** appear in any order within the ClientHello.
3. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: "pre_shared_key" **MAY** appear anywhere in the ServerHello, but not in the ClientHello except for at the end.
4. **Primary Rule (MUST NOT)**: There **MUST NOT** be multiple extensions of the same type in any given extension block.

#### Step 5: Classification Framework
- **Client-Side Rules (CLI)**:
  1. The client **MUST** ensure that "pre_shared_key" is the last extension in the ClientHello.
  2. The client **MUST NOT** include duplicate extension types within any extension block.
  
- **Server-Side Rules (SRV)**:
  1. The server **MUST** validate that "pre_shared_key" appears last in ClientHello.
  2. The server **MUST** reject any ClientHello message containing duplicate extension types.

#### Step 6: Rule Combination Logic
1. **Pairing Criteria**: The rules from the client side must align with those on the server side to ensure proper order and rejection of invalid messages.
2. **Combination Types**: Each rule about message construction (on the client side) has a corresponding rule about message processing (on the server side). These need to be logically paired to ensure that both parties follow the same protocol.

#### Step 7: Output Format
The final output will capture the client-side and server-side rules with the corresponding explicitness and detailed descriptions.

# }

# ---

# ### Thought Process for COT (Chain of Thought) Analysis:

# #### Step 1: Protocol Phase Identification
# - **Section**: "4.1.2.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Client Hello"
# - This section pertains to the Handshake phase of the TLS protocol, specifically focusing on the **ClientHello** message, which is crucial for initiating the handshake process between the client and server.

# #### Step 2: Message Flow Context
# - **Message Sequence**: The **ClientHello** is the first message sent by the client when connecting to a server. If a **HelloRetryRequest** is received from the server, the client must send a modified version of the original **ClientHello**.
# - **State Requirements**: The client must maintain the original **ClientHello**, with specific modifications based on the instructions provided in the **HelloRetryRequest**.

# #### Step 3: Security Context
# - **Security Concerns**: Modifying the **ClientHello** correctly after receiving the **HelloRetryRequest** is critical for maintaining security during the handshake. Incorrectly modifying the extensions or omitting required ones could lead to a failed handshake or insecure connections.
# - **Verification**: The server must validate that the client correctly modified its **ClientHello** as instructed. This ensures the integrity of the session and prevents attacks that exploit mismatches in protocol expectations.

# #### Step 4: Rule Extraction
# 1. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: After receiving a **HelloRetryRequest**, the client **MUST** send a modified **ClientHello** with specific required changes:
#    - The **key_share** extension must be modified according to the **HelloRetryRequest**.
#    - The **early_data** extension, if present, must be removed (as early data is not allowed after a **HelloRetryRequest**).
#    - The **cookie** extension, if provided by the server, must be included.
#    - The **pre_shared_key** extension, if present, must be updated with recalculated values.
#    - The **padding** extension may be modified or adjusted as needed.

# 2. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: The client **MAY** modify the **padding** extension according to its needs, as allowed by RFC7685.

# 3. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: The server **MUST** verify that the required modifications are present in the new **ClientHello**.

# 4. **Secondary Rule (MAY)**: The server **MUST** accept optional modifications to the **padding** extension, if present.

# #### Step 5: Classification Framework
# - **Client-Side Rules (CLI)**:
#   1. The client **MUST** modify the **ClientHello** as specified, including changes to the **key_share**, **early_data**, **cookie**, **pre_shared_key**, and **padding** extensions.
#   2. The client **MAY** adjust the **padding** extension as needed.
  
# - **Server-Side Rules (SRV)**:
#   1. The server **MUST** verify that the **ClientHello** contains the necessary modifications, ensuring compliance with the **HelloRetryRequest** instructions.
#   2. The server **MUST** accept modifications to the **pre_shared_key** and **padding** extensions as specified.

# #### Step 6: Rule Combination Logic
# 1. **Pairing Criteria**: The rules from the client side need to be paired with those on the server side to ensure that both parties follow the required modifications and verifications.
# 2. **Combination Types**: Each construction rule regarding client-side changes has a corresponding processing rule to ensure that the server can validate and accept the modified **ClientHello**.

# #### Step 7: Output Format
# The final output captures the client-side construction and server-side processing rules, with explicitness and detailed descriptions.

# ## EXAMPLE TWO
# ### INPUT
# {
#   "Section": "4.2.8.. Handshake Protocol_Extensions_Key Share",
#   "Title": "HelloRetryRequest KeyShare Data",
#   "Content": "In a HelloRetryRequest message, the \"extension_data\" field of this extension contains a KeyShareHelloRetryRequest value: selected_group: The mutually supported group the server intends to negotiate and is requesting a retried ClientHello/KeyShare for. Upon receipt of this extension in a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST verify that (1) the selected_group field corresponds to a group which was provided in the \"supported_groups\" extension in the original ClientHello and (2) the selected_group field does not correspond to a group which was provided in the \"key_share\" extension in the original ClientHello. If either of these checks fails, then the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. Otherwise, when sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST replace the original \"key_share\" extension with one containing only a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field of the triggering HelloRetryRequest."
# }

# ---

# ### Thought Process for COT (Chain of Thought) Analysis:

# #### Step 1: Protocol Phase Identification
# - **Section**: "4.2.8.. Handshake Protocol_Extensions_Key Share"
# - This section pertains to the Handshake phase of the TLS protocol, which is the phase responsible for negotiating cryptographic parameters. It specifies behavior related to the "HelloRetryRequest" message and how key share data should be handled in that context.

# #### Step 2: Message Flow Context
# - **Message Sequence**: The message in question is a **HelloRetryRequest**, which is sent by the server during the handshake to request a retry of the ClientHello message. The client must process this message, validate key share parameters, and respond with a modified ClientHello if the conditions are met.
# - **State Requirements**: The client must verify the group parameters specified in the **HelloRetryRequest** against the original **ClientHello**'s **supported_groups** and **key_share** extensions.

# #### Step 3: Security Context
# - This rule ensures that the client verifies the **selected_group** before proceeding, preventing potential security issues caused by mismatched or unauthorized groups.
# - By checking that the **selected_group** is both present in the **supported_groups** and absent from the original **key_share**, the protocol prevents improper or conflicting cryptographic parameters from being used.

# #### Step 4: Rule Extraction
# 1. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: Upon receipt of the HelloRetryRequest, the client **MUST** perform two verifications:
#    - (1) **selected_group** must exist in the **supported_groups** extension from the original ClientHello.
#    - (2) **selected_group** must not exist in the **key_share** extension from the original ClientHello.
   
# 2. **Primary Rule (MUST)**: If either verification fails, the client **MUST** abort the handshake and send an **illegal_parameter** alert.
   
# 3. **Secondary Rule (MUST)**: If both verifications succeed, the client **MUST** replace the original **key_share** extension with one containing only the new **KeyShareEntry** for the group indicated by the **selected_group**.

# #### Step 5: Classification Framework
# - **Client-Side Rules (CLI)**:
#   1. The client **MUST** verify the **selected_group** field against the **supported_groups** and **key_share** extensions in the original ClientHello.
#   2. If the verification fails, the client **MUST** abort the handshake and send an **illegal_parameter** alert.
#   3. If the verification succeeds, the client **MUST** send a new ClientHello, replacing the original **key_share** extension with a new **KeyShareEntry** for the **selected_group**.

# #### Step 6: Rule Combination Logic
# 1. **Pairing Criteria**: The construction and processing rules need to be paired logically to ensure that each step of the protocol (verification and construction of the new ClientHello) is properly executed in the right sequence.
# 2. **Combination Types**: Each processing rule corresponds to a specific construction rule, ensuring that the client performs the required verifications before constructing the new message.

# #### Step 7: Output Format
# The final output captures the client-side processing and message construction rules, with explicitness and detailed descriptions.
