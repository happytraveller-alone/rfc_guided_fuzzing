2,4.1.1.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Cryptographic Negotiation,Key Exchange Methods,"TLS 1.3 supports various key exchange methods, including (EC)DHE and pre-shared keys (PSK). The choice of key exchange impacts the security level and efficiency of the connection. Each party must ensure the selected method is compatible with their capabilities.","```json

3,4.1.1.. Handshake Protocol_Key Exchange Messages_Cryptographic Negotiation,Error Handling in Negotiation,"If the server cannot agree on a cipher suite or key exchange method, it must abort the handshake with an appropriate alert message, such as 'handshake_failure'. This ensures that both parties only proceed with secure and compatible parameters.","```json
