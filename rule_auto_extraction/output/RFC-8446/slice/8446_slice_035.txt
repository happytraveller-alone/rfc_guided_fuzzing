  "content": "The client's view of the age of a ticket is the time since the\n   receipt of the NewSessionTicket message.  Clients MUST NOT attempt to\n   use tickets which have ages greater than the \"ticket_lifetime\" value\n   which was provided with the ticket.  The \"obfuscated_ticket_age\"\n   field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the\n   ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the\n   \"ticket_age_add\" value that was included with the ticket (see\n   Section 4.6.1), modulo 2^32.  This addition prevents passive\n   observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused.\n   Note that the \"ticket_lifetime\" field in the NewSessionTicket message\n   is in seconds but the \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" is in milliseconds.\n   Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough\n   to represent any plausible age, even in milliseconds.",
