  "content": "The following rules apply to certificates sent by the client:\n\n   -  The certificate type MUST be X.509v3 [RFC5280], unless explicitly\n      negotiated otherwise (e.g., [RFC7250]).\n\n   -  If the \"certificate_authorities\" extension in the\n      CertificateRequest message was present, at least one of the\n      certificates in the certificate chain SHOULD be issued by one of\n      the listed CAs.\n\n   -  The certificates MUST be signed using an acceptable signature\n      algorithm, as described in Section 4.3.2.  Note that this relaxes\n      the constraints on certificate-signing algorithms found in prior\n      versions of TLS.\n\n   -  If the CertificateRequest message contained a non-empty\n      \"oid_filters\" extension, the end-entity certificate MUST match the\n      extension OIDs that are recognized by the client, as described in\n      Section 4.2.5.",
