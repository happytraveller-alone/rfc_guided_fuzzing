  "content": "The \"certificate_authorities\" extension is used to indicate the\n   certificate authorities (CAs) which an endpoint supports and which\n   SHOULD be used by the receiving endpoint to guide certificate\n   selection.\n\n   The body of the \"certificate_authorities\" extension consists of a\n   CertificateAuthoritiesExtension structure.\n\n      opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;\n\n      struct {\n          DistinguishedName authorities<3..2^16-1>;\n      } CertificateAuthoritiesExtension;\n\n   authorities:  A list of the distinguished names [X501] of acceptable\n      certificate authorities, represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.\n      These distinguished names specify a desired distinguished name for\n      a trust anchor or subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used\n      to describe known trust anchors as well as a desired authorization\n      space.\n\n   The client MAY send the \"certificate_authorities\" extension in the\n   ClientHello message.  The server MAY send it in the\n   CertificateRequest message.\n\n   The \"trusted_ca_keys\" extension [RFC6066], which serves a similar\n   purpose but is more complicated, is not used in TLS 1.3 (although it\n   may appear in ClientHello messages from clients which are offering\n   prior versions of TLS).",
