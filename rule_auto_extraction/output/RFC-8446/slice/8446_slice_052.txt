  "content": "At any time after the server has received the client Finished\n   message, it MAY send a NewSessionTicket message.  This message\n   creates a unique association between the ticket value and a secret\n   PSK derived from the resumption master secret (see Section 7).\n\n   The client MAY use this PSK for future handshakes by including the\n   ticket value in the \"pre_shared_key\" extension in its ClientHello\n   (Section 4.2.11).  Servers MAY send multiple tickets on a single\n   connection, either immediately after each other or after specific\n   events (see Appendix C.4).  For instance, the server might send a new\n   ticket after post-handshake authentication in order to encapsulate\n   the additional client authentication state.  Multiple tickets are\n   useful for clients for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n   -  Opening multiple parallel HTTP connections.\n\n   -  Performing connection racing across interfaces and address\n      families via (for example) Happy Eyeballs [RFC8305] or related\n      techniques.\n\n   Any ticket MUST only be resumed with a cipher suite that has the same\n   KDF hash algorithm as that used to establish the original connection.\n\n   Clients MUST only resume if the new SNI value is valid for the server\n   certificate presented in the original session and SHOULD only resume\n   if the SNI value matches the one used in the original session.  The\n   latter is a performance optimization: normally, there is no reason to\n   expect that different servers covered by a single certificate would\n   be able to accept each other's tickets; hence, attempting resumption\n   in that case would waste a single-use ticket.  If such an indication\n   is provided (externally or by any other means), clients MAY resume\n   with a different SNI value.\n\n   On resumption, if reporting an SNI value to the calling application,\n   implementations MUST use the value sent in the resumption ClientHello\n   rather than the value sent in the previous session.  Note that if a\n   server implementation declines all PSK identities with different SNI\n   values, these two values are always the same.\n\n   Note: Although the resumption master secret depends on the client's\n   second flight, a server which does not request client authentication\n   MAY compute the remainder of the transcript independently and then\n   send a NewSessionTicket immediately upon sending its Finished rather\n   than waiting for the client Finished.  This might be appropriate in\n   cases where the client is expected to open multiple TLS connections\n   in parallel and would benefit from the reduced overhead of a\n   resumption handshake, for example.\n\n      struct {\n          uint32 ticket_lifetime;\n          uint32 ticket_age_add;\n          opaque ticket_nonce<0..255>;\n          opaque ticket<1..2^16-1>;\n          Extension extensions<0..2^16-2>;\n      } NewSessionTicket;\n\n   ticket_lifetime:  Indicates the lifetime in seconds as a 32-bit\n      unsigned integer in network byte order from the time of ticket\n      issuance.  Servers MUST NOT use any value greater than\n      604800 seconds (7 days).  The value of zero indicates that the\n      ticket should be discarded immediately.  Clients MUST NOT cache\n      tickets for longer than 7 days, regardless of the ticket_lifetime,\n      and MAY delete tickets earlier based on local policy.  A server\n      MAY treat a ticket as valid for a shorter period of time than what\n      is stated in the ticket_lifetime.\n\n   ticket_age_add:  A securely generated, random 32-bit value that is\n      used to obscure the age of the ticket that the client includes in\n      the \"pre_shared_key\" extension.  The client-side ticket age is\n      added to this value modulo 2^32 to obtain the value that is\n      transmitted by the client.  The server MUST generate a fresh value\n      for each ticket it sends.\n\n   ticket_nonce:  A per-ticket value that is unique across all tickets\n      issued on this connection.\n\n   ticket:  The value of the ticket to be used as the PSK identity.  The\n      ticket itself is an opaque label.  It MAY be either a database\n      lookup key or a self-encrypted and self-authenticated value.\n\n   extensions:  A set of extension values for the ticket.  The\n      \"Extension\" format is defined in Section 4.2.  Clients MUST ignore\n      unrecognized extensions.\n\n   The sole extension currently defined for NewSessionTicket is\n   \"early_data\", indicating that the ticket may be used to send 0-RTT\n   data (Section 4.2.10).  It contains the following value:\n\n   max_early_data_size:  The maximum amount of 0-RTT data that the\n      client is allowed to send when using this ticket, in bytes.  Only\n      Application Data payload (i.e., plaintext but not padding or the\n      inner content type byte) is counted.  A server receiving more than\n      max_early_data_size bytes of 0-RTT data SHOULD terminate the\n      connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert.  Note that servers\n      that reject early data due to lack of cryptographic material will\n      be unable to differentiate padding from content, so clients\n      SHOULD NOT depend on being able to send large quantities of\n      padding in early data records.\n\n   The PSK associated with the ticket is computed as:\n\n       HKDF-Expand-Label(resumption_master_secret,\n                        \"resumption\", ticket_nonce, Hash.length)\n\n   Because the ticket_nonce value is distinct for each NewSessionTicket\n   message, a different PSK will be derived for each ticket.\n\n   Note that in principle it is possible to continue issuing new tickets\n   which indefinitely extend the lifetime of the keying material\n   originally derived from an initial non-PSK handshake (which was most\n   likely tied to the peer's certificate).  It is RECOMMENDED that\n   implementations place limits on the total lifetime of such keying\n   material; these limits should take into account the lifetime of the\n   peer's certificate, the likelihood of intervening revocation, and the\n   time since the peer's online CertificateVerify signature.",
