  "content": "Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters for both clients and servers are\n   encoded in the opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a\n   KeyShare structure.  The opaque value contains the Diffie-Hellman\n   public value (Y = g^X mod p) for the specified group (see [RFC7919]\n   for group definitions) encoded as a big-endian integer and padded to\n   the left with zeros to the size of p in bytes.\n\n   Note: For a given Diffie-Hellman group, the padding results in all\n   public keys having the same length.\n\n   Peers MUST validate each other's public key Y by ensuring that 1 < Y\n   < p-1.  This check ensures that the remote peer is properly behaved\n   and isn't forcing the local system into a small subgroup.",
