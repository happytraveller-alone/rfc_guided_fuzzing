  "content": "When the client has sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension (see\n   Section 4.2.6), a server MAY request client authentication at any\n   time after the handshake has completed by sending a\n   CertificateRequest message.  The client MUST respond with the\n   appropriate Authentication messages (see Section 4.4).  If the client\n   chooses to authenticate, it MUST send Certificate, CertificateVerify,\n\n   and Finished.  If it declines, it MUST send a Certificate message\n   containing no certificates followed by Finished.  All of the client's\n   messages for a given response MUST appear consecutively on the wire\n   with no intervening messages of other types.\n\n   A client that receives a CertificateRequest message without having\n   sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension MUST send an\n   \"unexpected_message\" fatal alert.\n\n   Note: Because client authentication could involve prompting the user,\n   servers MUST be prepared for some delay, including receiving an\n   arbitrary number of other messages between sending the\n   CertificateRequest and receiving a response.  In addition, clients\n   which receive multiple CertificateRequests in close succession MAY\n   respond to them in a different order than they were received (the\n   certificate_request_context value allows the server to disambiguate\n   the responses).",
