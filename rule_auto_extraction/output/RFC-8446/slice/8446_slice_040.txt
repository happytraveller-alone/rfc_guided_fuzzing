  "content": "A server which is authenticating with a certificate MAY optionally\n   request a certificate from the client.  This message, if sent, MUST\n   follow EncryptedExtensions.\n\n   Structure of this message:\n\n      struct {\n          opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;\n          Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>;\n      } CertificateRequest;\n\n   certificate_request_context:  An opaque string which identifies the\n      certificate request and which will be echoed in the client's\n      Certificate message.  The certificate_request_context MUST be\n      unique within the scope of this connection (thus preventing replay\n      of client CertificateVerify messages).  This field SHALL be zero\n      length unless used for the post-handshake authentication exchanges\n      described in Section 4.6.2.  When requesting post-handshake\n      authentication, the server SHOULD make the context unpredictable\n      to the client (e.g., by randomly generating it) in order to\n      prevent an attacker who has temporary access to the client's\n      private key from pre-computing valid CertificateVerify messages.\n\n   extensions:  A set of extensions describing the parameters of the\n      certificate being requested.  The \"signature_algorithms\" extension\n      MUST be specified, and other extensions may optionally be included\n      if defined for this message.  Clients MUST ignore unrecognized\n      extensions.\n\n   In prior versions of TLS, the CertificateRequest message carried a\n   list of signature algorithms and certificate authorities which the\n   server would accept.  In TLS 1.3, the former is expressed by sending\n   the \"signature_algorithms\" and optionally \"signature_algorithms_cert\"\n   extensions.  The latter is expressed by sending the\n   \"certificate_authorities\" extension (see Section 4.2.4).\n\n   Servers which are authenticating with a PSK MUST NOT send the\n   CertificateRequest message in the main handshake, though they MAY\n   send it in post-handshake authentication (see Section 4.6.2) provided\n   that the client has sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension (see\n   Section 4.2.6).",
