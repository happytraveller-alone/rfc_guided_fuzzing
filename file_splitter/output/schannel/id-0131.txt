Function Background: The function is reverse engineered from the driver file Schannel.dll on Windows platform. Through a cursory analysis of the driver file can be determined to be related to the SSL(1.3), TLS(3.0) protocol, that is, with RFC8446, RFC6101 strong correlation.

Output Function Summary: Summarizes the function's functionality with several phrases instead of sentences, focuses on covering the function's control flow information (API), and highlights the protocol function points implemented by the function. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Suppose the code support the latest newwork protocol SSL(3.0) AND TLS(1.3)

Output Code Match RFC Result: Give the number and the link of the RFC file associated with each protocol associated with the code (a protocol corresponds to at least one RFC file). Including at least RFC8446(tls1.3) or RFC6101(ssl3.0),
