CONTENT:<
--- Section: 2.3. Lexical Analysis of Messages_Body ---
The body of a message is simply lines of US-ASCII characters.  The
   only two limitations on the body are as follows:

   o  CR and LF MUST only occur together as CRLF; they MUST NOT appear
      independently in the body.
   o  Lines of characters in the body MUST be limited to 998 characters,
      and SHOULD be limited to 78 characters, excluding the CRLF.

      Note: As was stated earlier, there are other documents,
      specifically the MIME documents ([RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2049],
      [RFC4288], [RFC4289]), that extend (and limit) this specification
      to allow for different sorts of message bodies.  Again, these
      mechanisms are beyond the scope of this document.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
