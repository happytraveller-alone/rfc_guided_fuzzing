--- Section: 3.6.7. Syntax_Field Definitions_Trace Fields ---
The trace fields are a group of header fields consisting of an
   optional "Return-Path:" field, and one or more "Received:" fields.
   The "Return-Path:" header field contains a pair of angle brackets
   that enclose an optional addr-spec.  The "Received:" field contains a
   (possibly empty) list of tokens followed by a semicolon and a date-
   time specification.  Each token must be a word, angle-addr, addr-
   spec, or a domain.  Further restrictions are applied to the syntax of
   the trace fields by specifications that provide for their use, such
   as [RFC5321].

   trace           =   [return]
                       1*received

   return          =   "Return-Path:" path CRLF

   path            =   angle-addr / ([CFWS] "<" [CFWS] ">" [CFWS])

   received        =   "Received:" *received-token ";" date-time CRLF

   received-token  =   word / angle-addr / addr-spec / domain

   A full discussion of the Internet mail use of trace fields is
   contained in [RFC5321].  For the purposes of this specification, the
   trace fields are strictly informational, and any formal
   interpretation of them is outside of the scope of this document.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
