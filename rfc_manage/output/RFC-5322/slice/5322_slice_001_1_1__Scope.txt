CONTENT:<
--- Section: 1.1. Scope ---
This document specifies the Internet Message Format (IMF), a syntax
   for text messages that are sent between computer users, within the
   framework of "electronic mail" messages.  This specification is an
   update to [RFC2822], which itself superseded [RFC0822], updating it
   to reflect current practice and incorporating incremental changes
   that were specified in other RFCs such as [RFC1123].

   This document specifies a syntax only for text messages.  In
   particular, it makes no provision for the transmission of images,
   audio, or other sorts of structured data in electronic mail messages.
   There are several extensions published, such as the MIME document
   series ([RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2049]), which describe mechanisms
   for the transmission of such data through electronic mail, either by
   extending the syntax provided here or by structuring such messages to
   conform to this syntax.  Those mechanisms are outside of the scope of
   this specification.

   In the context of electronic mail, messages are viewed as having an
   envelope and contents.  The envelope contains whatever information is
   needed to accomplish transmission and delivery.  (See [RFC5321] for a
   discussion of the envelope.)  The contents comprise the object to be
   delivered to the recipient.  This specification applies only to the
   format and some of the semantics of message contents.  It contains no
   specification of the information in the envelope.

   However, some message systems may use information from the contents
   to create the envelope.  It is intended that this specification
   facilitate the acquisition of such information by programs.

   This specification is intended as a definition of what message
   content format is to be passed between systems.  Though some message
   systems locally store messages in this format (which eliminates the
   need for translation between formats) and others use formats that
   differ from the one specified in this specification, local storage is
   outside of the scope of this specification.

      Note: This specification is not intended to dictate the internal
      formats used by sites, the specific message system features that
      they are expected to support, or any of the characteristics of
      user interface programs that create or read messages.  In
      addition, this document does not specify an encoding of the
      characters for either transport or storage; that is, it does not
      specify the number of bits used or how those bits are specifically
      transferred over the wire or stored on disk.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
