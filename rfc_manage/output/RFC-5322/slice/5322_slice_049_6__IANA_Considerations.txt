Appendix A.  Example Messages

   This section presents a selection of messages.  These are intended to
   assist in the implementation of this specification, but should not be
   taken as normative; that is to say, although the examples in this
   section were carefully reviewed, if there happens to be a conflict
   between these examples and the syntax described in sections 3 and 4
   of this document, the syntax in those sections is to be taken as
   correct.

   In the text version of this document, messages in this section are
   delimited between lines of "----".  The "----" lines are not part of
   the message itself.

Appendix A.1.  Addressing Examples

   The following are examples of messages that might be sent between two
   individuals.

Appendix A.1.1.  A Message from One Person to Another with Simple
                 Addressing

   This could be called a canonical message.  It has a single author,
   John Doe, a single recipient, Mary Smith, a subject, the date, a
   message identifier, and a textual message in the body.

   ----
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

   If John's secretary Michael actually sent the message, even though
   John was the author and replies to this message should go back to
   him, the sender field would be used:

   ----
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   Sender: Michael Jones <mjones@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

Appendix A.1.2.  Different Types of Mailboxes

   This message includes multiple addresses in the destination fields
   and also uses several different forms of addresses.

   ----
   From: "Joe Q. Public" <john.q.public@example.com>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@x.test>, jdoe@example.org, Who? <one@y.test>
   Cc: <boss@nil.test>, "Giant; \"Big\" Box" <sysservices@example.net>
   Date: Tue, 1 Jul 2003 10:52:37 +0200
   Message-ID: <5678.21-Nov-1997@example.com>

   Hi everyone.
   ----

   Note that the display names for Joe Q. Public and Giant; "Big" Box
   needed to be enclosed in double-quotes because the former contains
   the period and the latter contains both semicolon and double-quote
   characters (the double-quote characters appearing as quoted-pair
   constructs).  Conversely, the display name for Who? could appear
   without them because the question mark is legal in an atom.  Notice
   also that jdoe@example.org and boss@nil.test have no display names
   associated with them at all, and jdoe@example.org uses the simpler
   address form without the angle brackets.

Appendix A.1.3.  Group Addresses

   ----
   From: Pete <pete@silly.example>
   To: A Group:Ed Jones <c@a.test>,joe@where.test,John <jdoe@one.test>;
   Cc: Undisclosed recipients:;
   Date: Thu, 13 Feb 1969 23:32:54 -0330
   Message-ID: <testabcd.1234@silly.example>

   Testing.
   ----

   In this message, the "To:" field has a single group recipient named
   "A Group", which contains 3 addresses, and a "Cc:" field with an
   empty group recipient named Undisclosed recipients.

Appendix A.2.  Reply Messages

   The following is a series of three messages that make up a
   conversation thread between John and Mary.  John first sends a
   message to Mary, Mary then replies to John's message, and then John
   replies to Mary's reply message.

   Note especially the "Message-ID:", "References:", and "In-Reply-To:"
   fields in each message.

   ----
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

   When sending replies, the Subject field is often retained, though
   prepended with "Re: " as described in section 3.6.5.

   ----
   From: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   To: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   Reply-To: "Mary Smith: Personal Account" <smith@home.example>
   Subject: Re: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 10:01:10 -0600
   Message-ID: <3456@example.net>
   In-Reply-To: <1234@local.machine.example>
   References: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a reply to your hello.
   ----

   Note the "Reply-To:" field in the above message.  When John replies
   to Mary's message above, the reply should go to the address in the
   "Reply-To:" field instead of the address in the "From:" field.

   ----
   To: "Mary Smith: Personal Account" <smith@home.example>
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   Subject: Re: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 11:00:00 -0600
   Message-ID: <abcd.1234@local.machine.test>
   In-Reply-To: <3456@example.net>
   References: <1234@local.machine.example> <3456@example.net>

   This is a reply to your reply.
   ----

Appendix A.3.  Resent Messages

   Start with the message that has been used as an example several
   times:

   ----
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

   Say that Mary, upon receiving this message, wishes to send a copy of
   the message to Jane such that (a) the message would appear to have
   come straight from John; (b) if Jane replies to the message, the
   reply should go back to John; and (c) all of the original
   information, like the date the message was originally sent to Mary,
   the message identifier, and the original addressee, is preserved.  In
   this case, resent fields are prepended to the message:

   ----
   Resent-From: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Resent-To: Jane Brown <j-brown@other.example>
   Resent-Date: Mon, 24 Nov 1997 14:22:01 -0800
   Resent-Message-ID: <78910@example.net>
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

   If Jane, in turn, wished to resend this message to another person,
   she would prepend her own set of resent header fields to the above
   and send that.  (Note that for brevity, trace fields are not shown.)

Appendix A.4.  Messages with Trace Fields

   As messages are sent through the transport system as described in
   [RFC5321], trace fields are prepended to the message.  The following
   is an example of what those trace fields might look like.  Note that
   there is some folding white space in the first one since these lines
   can be long.

   ----
   Received: from x.y.test
      by example.net
      via TCP
      with ESMTP
      id ABC12345
      for <mary@example.net>;  21 Nov 1997 10:05:43 -0600
   Received: from node.example by x.y.test; 21 Nov 1997 10:01:22 -0600
   From: John Doe <jdoe@node.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
   Message-ID: <1234@local.node.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

Appendix A.5.  White Space, Comments, and Other Oddities

   White space, including folding white space, and comments can be
   inserted between many of the tokens of fields.  Taking the example
   from A.1.3, white space and comments can be inserted into all of the
   fields.

   ----
   From: Pete(A nice \) chap) <pete(his account)@silly.test(his host)>
   To:A Group(Some people)
        :Chris Jones <c@(Chris's host.)public.example>,
            joe@example.org,
     John <jdoe@one.test> (my dear friend); (the end of the group)
   Cc:(Empty list)(start)Hidden recipients  :(nobody(that I know))  ;
   Date: Thu,
         13
           Feb
             1969
         23:32
                  -0330 (Newfoundland Time)
   Message-ID:              <testabcd.1234@silly.test>

   Testing.
   ----

   The above example is aesthetically displeasing, but perfectly legal.
   Note particularly (1) the comments in the "From:" field (including
   one that has a ")" character appearing as part of a quoted-pair); (2)
   the white space absent after the ":" in the "To:" field as well as
   the comment and folding white space after the group name, the special
   character (".") in the comment in Chris Jones's address, and the
   folding white space before and after "joe@example.org,"; (3) the
   multiple and nested comments in the "Cc:" field as well as the
   comment immediately following the ":" after "Cc"; (4) the folding
   white space (but no comments except at the end) and the missing
   seconds in the time of the date field; and (5) the white space before
   (but not within) the identifier in the "Message-ID:" field.

Appendix A.6.  Obsoleted Forms

   The following are examples of obsolete (that is, the "MUST NOT
   generate") syntactic elements described in section 4 of this
   document.

Appendix A.6.1.  Obsolete Addressing

   Note in the example below the lack of quotes around Joe Q. Public,
   the route that appears in the address for Mary Smith, the two commas
   that appear in the "To:" field, and the spaces that appear around the
   "." in the jdoe address.

   ----
   From: Joe Q. Public <john.q.public@example.com>
   To: Mary Smith <@node.test:mary@example.net>, , jdoe@test  . example
   Date: Tue, 1 Jul 2003 10:52:37 +0200
   Message-ID: <5678.21-Nov-1997@example.com>

   Hi everyone.
   ----

Appendix A.6.2.  Obsolete Dates

   The following message uses an obsolete date format, including a non-
   numeric time zone and a two digit year.  Note that although the day-
   of-week is missing, that is not specific to the obsolete syntax; it
   is optional in the current syntax as well.

   ----
   From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
   To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
   Subject: Saying Hello
   Date: 21 Nov 97 09:55:06 GMT
   Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

Appendix A.6.3.  Obsolete White Space and Comments

   White space and comments can appear between many more elements than
   in the current syntax.  Also, folding lines that are made up entirely
   of white space are legal.

   ----
   From  : John Doe <jdoe@machine(comment).  example>
   To    : Mary Smith
   __
             <mary@example.net>
   Subject     : Saying Hello
   Date  : Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09(comment):   55  :  06 -0600
   Message-ID  : <1234   @   local(blah)  .machine .example>

   This is a message just to say hello.
   So, "Hello".
   ----

   Note especially the second line of the "To:" field.  It starts with
   two space characters.  (Note that "__" represent blank spaces.)
   Therefore, it is considered part of the folding, as described in
   section 4.2.  Also, the comments and white space throughout
   addresses, dates, and message identifiers are all part of the
   obsolete syntax.

Appendix B.  Differences from Earlier Specifications

   This appendix contains a list of changes that have been made in the
   Internet Message Format from earlier specifications, specifically
   [RFC0822], [RFC1123], and [RFC2822].  Items marked with an asterisk
   (*) below are items which appear in section 4 of this document and
   therefore can no longer be generated.

   10.  Clarified that other specifications limit domain syntax.
   11.  Simplified "Bcc:" and "Resent-Bcc:" syntax.
   12.  Allowed optional-field to appear within trace information.
   13.  Removed no-fold-quote from msg-id.  Clarified syntax
        limitations.
   14.  Generalized "Received:" syntax to fix bugs and move definition
        out of this document.
   15.  Simplified obs-qp.  Fixed and simplified obs-utext (which now
        only appears in the obsolete syntax).  Removed obs-text and obs-

        and white space.
   17.  Fixed all obsolete list syntax (obs-domain-list, obs-mbox-list,
        obs-addr-list, obs-phrase-list, and the newly added obs-group-
        list).
   18.  Fixed obs-reply-to syntax.
   19.  Fixed obs-bcc and obs-resent-bcc to allow empty lists.
   20.  Removed obs-path.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
