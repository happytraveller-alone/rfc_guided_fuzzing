--- Section: 2.1. Lexical Analysis of Messages_General Description ---
At the most basic level, a message is a series of characters.  A
   message that is conformant with this specification is composed of
   characters with values in the range of 1 through 127 and interpreted
   as US-ASCII [ANSI.X3-4.1986] characters.  For brevity, this document
   sometimes refers to this range of characters as simply "US-ASCII
   characters".

      Note: This document specifies that messages are made up of
      characters in the US-ASCII range of 1 through 127.  There are
      other documents, specifically the MIME document series ([RFC2045],
      [RFC2046], [RFC2047], [RFC2049], [RFC4288], [RFC4289]), that
      extend this specification to allow for values outside of that
      range.  Discussion of those mechanisms is not within the scope of
      this specification.

   Messages are divided into lines of characters.  A line is a series of
   characters that is delimited with the two characters carriage-return
   and line-feed; that is, the carriage return (CR) character (ASCII
   value 13) followed immediately by the line feed (LF) character (ASCII
   value 10).  (The carriage return/line feed pair is usually written in
   this document as "CRLF".)

   A message consists of header fields (collectively called "the header
   section of the message") followed, optionally, by a body.  The header
   section is a sequence of lines of characters with special syntax as
   defined in this specification.  The body is simply a sequence of
   characters that follows the header section and is separated from the
   header section by an empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding
   the CRLF).

      Note: Common parlance and earlier versions of this specification
      use the term "header" to either refer to the entire header section
      or to refer to an individual header field.  To avoid ambiguity,
      this document does not use the terms "header" or "headers" in
      isolation, but instead always uses "header field" to refer to the
      individual field and "header section" to refer to the entire
      collection.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
