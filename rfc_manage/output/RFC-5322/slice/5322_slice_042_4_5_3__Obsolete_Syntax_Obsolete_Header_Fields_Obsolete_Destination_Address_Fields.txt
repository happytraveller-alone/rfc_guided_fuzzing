CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.5.3. Obsolete Syntax_Obsolete Header Fields_Obsolete Destination Address Fields ---
obs-to          =   "To" *WSP ":" address-list CRLF

   obs-cc          =   "Cc" *WSP ":" address-list CRLF

   obs-bcc         =   "Bcc" *WSP ":"
                       (address-list / (*([CFWS] ",") [CFWS])) CRLF

   When multiple occurrences of destination address fields occur in a
   message, they SHOULD be treated as if the address list in the first
   occurrence of the field is combined with the address lists of the
   subsequent occurrences by adding a comma and concatenating.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
