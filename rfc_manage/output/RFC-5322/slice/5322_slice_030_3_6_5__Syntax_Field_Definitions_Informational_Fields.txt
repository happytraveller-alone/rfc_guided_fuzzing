CONTENT:<
--- Section: 3.6.5. Syntax_Field Definitions_Informational Fields ---
The informational fields are all optional.  The "Subject:" and
   "Comments:" fields are unstructured fields as defined in section
   2.2.1, and therefore may contain text or folding white space.  The
   "Keywords:" field contains a comma-separated list of one or more
   words or quoted-strings.

   subject         =   "Subject:" unstructured CRLF

   comments        =   "Comments:" unstructured CRLF

   keywords        =   "Keywords:" phrase *("," phrase) CRLF

   These three fields are intended to have only human-readable content
   with information about the message.  The "Subject:" field is the most
   common and contains a short string identifying the topic of the

   message.  When used in a reply, the field body MAY start with the
   string "Re: " (an abbreviation of the Latin "in re", meaning "in the
   matter of") followed by the contents of the "Subject:" field body of
   the original message.  If this is done, only one instance of the
   literal string "Re: " ought to be used since use of other strings or
   more than one instance can lead to undesirable consequences.  The
   "Comments:" field contains any additional comments on the text of the
   body of the message.  The "Keywords:" field contains a comma-
   separated list of important words and phrases that might be useful
   for the recipient.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
