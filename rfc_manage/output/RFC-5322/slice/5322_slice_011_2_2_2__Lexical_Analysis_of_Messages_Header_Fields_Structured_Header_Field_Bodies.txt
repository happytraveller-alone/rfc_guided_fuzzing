--- Section: 2.2.2. Lexical Analysis of Messages_Header Fields_Structured Header Field Bodies ---
Some field bodies in this specification have a syntax that is more
   restrictive than the unstructured field bodies described above.
   These are referred to as "structured" field bodies.  Structured field
   bodies are sequences of specific lexical tokens as described in
   sections 3 and 4 of this specification.  Many of these tokens are
   allowed (according to their syntax) to be introduced or end with
   comments (as described in section 3.2.2) as well as the white space
   characters, and those white space characters are subject to "folding"
   and "unfolding" as described in section 2.2.3.  Semantic analysis of
   structured field bodies is given along with their syntax.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
