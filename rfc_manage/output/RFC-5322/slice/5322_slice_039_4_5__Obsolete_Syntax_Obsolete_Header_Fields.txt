--- Section: 4.5. Obsolete Syntax_Obsolete Header Fields ---
Syntactically, the primary difference in the obsolete field syntax is
   that it allows multiple occurrences of any of the fields and they may
   occur in any order.  Also, any amount of white space is allowed
   before the ":" at the end of the field name.

   obs-fields      =   *(obs-return /
                       obs-received /
                       obs-orig-date /
                       obs-from /
                       obs-sender /
                       obs-reply-to /
                       obs-to /
                       obs-cc /
                       obs-bcc /
                       obs-message-id /
                       obs-in-reply-to /
                       obs-references /
                       obs-subject /
                       obs-comments /
                       obs-keywords /
                       obs-resent-date /
                       obs-resent-from /
                       obs-resent-send /
                       obs-resent-rply /
                       obs-resent-to /
                       obs-resent-cc /
                       obs-resent-bcc /
                       obs-resent-mid /
                       obs-optional)

   Except for destination address fields (described in section 4.5.3),
   the interpretation of multiple occurrences of fields is unspecified.
   Also, the interpretation of trace fields and resent fields that do
   not occur in blocks prepended to the message is unspecified as well.
   Unless otherwise noted in the following sections, interpretation of
   other fields is identical to the interpretation of their non-obsolete
   counterparts in section 3.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
