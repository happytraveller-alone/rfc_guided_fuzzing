--- Section: 2.1.1. Lexical Analysis of Messages_General Description_Line Length Limits ---
There are two limits that this specification places on the number of
   characters in a line.  Each line of characters MUST be no more than
   998 characters, and SHOULD be no more than 78 characters, excluding
   the CRLF.

   The 998 character limit is due to limitations in many implementations
   that send, receive, or store IMF messages which simply cannot handle
   more than 998 characters on a line.  Receiving implementations would
   do well to handle an arbitrarily large number of characters in a line
   for robustness sake.  However, there are so many implementations that
   (in compliance with the transport requirements of [RFC5321]) do not
   accept messages containing more than 1000 characters including the CR
   and LF per line, it is important for implementations not to create
   such messages.

   The more conservative 78 character recommendation is to accommodate
   the many implementations of user interfaces that display these
   messages which may truncate, or disastrously wrap, the display of
   more than 78 characters per line, in spite of the fact that such
   implementations are non-conformant to the intent of this
   specification (and that of [RFC5321] if they actually cause
   information to be lost).  Again, even though this limitation is put
   on messages, it is incumbent upon implementations that display
   messages to handle an arbitrarily large number of characters in a
   line (certainly at least up to the 998 character limit) for the sake
   of robustness.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
