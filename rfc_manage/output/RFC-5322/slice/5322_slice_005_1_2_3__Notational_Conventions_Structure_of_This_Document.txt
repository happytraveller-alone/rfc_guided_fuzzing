--- Section: 1.2.3. Notational Conventions_Structure of This Document ---
This document is divided into several sections.

   This section, section 1, is a short introduction to the document.

   Section 2 lays out the general description of a message and its
   constituent parts.  This is an overview to help the reader understand
   some of the general principles used in the later portions of this
   document.  Any examples in this section MUST NOT be taken as
   specification of the formal syntax of any part of a message.

   Section 3 specifies formal ABNF rules for the structure of each part
   of a message (the syntax) and describes the relationship between
   those parts and their meaning in the context of a message (the
   semantics).  That is, it lays out the actual rules for the structure
   of each part of a message (the syntax) as well as a description of
   the parts and instructions for their interpretation (the semantics).
   This includes analysis of the syntax and semantics of subparts of
   messages that have specific structure.  The syntax included in
   section 3 represents messages as they MUST be created.  There are
   also notes in section 3 to indicate if any of the options specified
   in the syntax SHOULD be used over any of the others.

   Both sections 2 and 3 describe messages that are legal to generate
   for purposes of this specification.

   Section 4 of this document specifies an "obsolete" syntax.  There are
   references in section 3 to these obsolete syntactic elements.  The
   rules of the obsolete syntax are elements that have appeared in
   earlier versions of this specification or have previously been widely
   used in Internet messages.  As such, these elements MUST be
   interpreted by parsers of messages in order to be conformant to this
   specification.  However, since items in this syntax have been
   determined to be non-interoperable or to cause significant problems
   for recipients of messages, they MUST NOT be generated by creators of
   conformant messages.

   Section 5 details security considerations to take into account when
   implementing this specification.

   Appendix A lists examples of different sorts of messages.  These
   examples are not exhaustive of the types of messages that appear on
   the Internet, but give a broad overview of certain syntactic forms.

   Appendix B lists the differences between this specification and
   earlier specifications for Internet messages.

   Appendix C contains acknowledgements.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
