CONTENT:<
--- Section: 3.2.5. Syntax_Lexical Tokens_Miscellaneous Tokens ---
Three additional tokens are defined: word and phrase for combinations
   of atoms and/or quoted-strings, and unstructured for use in
   unstructured header fields and in some places within structured
   header fields.

   word            =   atom / quoted-string

   phrase          =   1*word / obs-phrase

   unstructured    =   (*([FWS] VCHAR) *WSP) / obs-unstruct

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
