--- Section: 4.1. Obsolete Syntax_Miscellaneous Obsolete Tokens ---
These syntactic elements are used elsewhere in the obsolete syntax or
   in the main syntax.  Bare CR, bare LF, and NUL are added to obs-qp,
   obs-body, and obs-unstruct.  US-ASCII control characters are added to
   obs-qp, obs-unstruct, obs-ctext, and obs-qtext.  The period character
   is added to obs-phrase.  The obs-phrase-list provides for a
   (potentially empty) comma-separated list of phrases that may include
   "null" elements.  That is, there could be two or more commas in such
   a list with nothing in between them, or commas at the beginning or
   end of the list.

      Note: The "period" (or "full stop") character (".") in obs-phrase
      is not a form that was allowed in earlier versions of this or any
      other specification.  Period (nor any other character from
      specials) was not allowed in phrase because it introduced a
      parsing difficulty distinguishing between phrases and portions of
      an addr-spec (see section 4.4).  It appears here because the
      period character is currently used in many messages in the
      display-name portion of addresses, especially for initials in
      names, and therefore must be interpreted properly.

   obs-NO-WS-CTL   =   %d1-8 /            ; US-ASCII control
                       %d11 /             ;  characters that do not
                       %d12 /             ;  include the carriage
                       %d14-31 /          ;  return, line feed, and
                       %d127              ;  white space characters

   obs-ctext       =   obs-NO-WS-CTL

   obs-qtext       =   obs-NO-WS-CTL

   obs-utext       =   %d0 / obs-NO-WS-CTL / VCHAR

   obs-qp          =   "\" (%d0 / obs-NO-WS-CTL / LF / CR)

   obs-body        =   *((*LF *CR *((%d0 / text) *LF *CR)) / CRLF)

   obs-unstruct    =   *((*LF *CR *(obs-utext *LF *CR)) / FWS)

   obs-phrase      =   word *(word / "." / CFWS)

   obs-phrase-list =   [phrase / CFWS] *("," [phrase / CFWS])

   Bare CR and bare LF appear in messages with two different meanings.
   In many cases, bare CR or bare LF are used improperly instead of CRLF
   to indicate line separators.  In other cases, bare CR and bare LF are
   used simply as US-ASCII control characters with their traditional
   ASCII meanings.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
