--- Section: 3.4.1. Syntax_Address Specification_Addr-Spec Specification ---
An addr-spec is a specific Internet identifier that contains a
   locally interpreted string followed by the at-sign character ("@",
   ASCII value 64) followed by an Internet domain.  The locally
   interpreted string is either a quoted-string or a dot-atom.  If the
   string can be represented as a dot-atom (that is, it contains no
   characters other than atext characters or "." surrounded by atext
   characters), then the dot-atom form SHOULD be used and the quoted-
   string form SHOULD NOT be used.  Comments and folding white space
   SHOULD NOT be used around the "@" in the addr-spec.

      Note: A liberal syntax for the domain portion of addr-spec is
      given here.  However, the domain portion contains addressing
      information specified by and used in other protocols (e.g.,
      [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC1123], [RFC5321]).  It is therefore
      incumbent upon implementations to conform to the syntax of
      addresses for the context in which they are used.

   addr-spec       =   local-part "@" domain

   local-part      =   dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part

   domain          =   dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain

   domain-literal  =   [CFWS] "[" *([FWS] dtext) [FWS] "]" [CFWS]

   dtext           =   %d33-90 /          ; Printable US-ASCII
                       %d94-126 /         ;  characters not including
                       obs-dtext          ;  "[", "]", or "\"

   The domain portion identifies the point to which the mail is
   delivered.  In the dot-atom form, this is interpreted as an Internet
   domain name (either a host name or a mail exchanger name) as
   described in [RFC1034], [RFC1035], and [RFC1123].  In the domain-
   literal form, the domain is interpreted as the literal Internet
   address of the particular host.  In both cases, how addressing is
   used and how messages are transported to a particular host is covered
   in separate documents, such as [RFC5321].  These mechanisms are
   outside of the scope of this document.

   The local-part portion is a domain-dependent string.  In addresses,
   it is simply interpreted on the particular host as a name of a
   particular mailbox.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
