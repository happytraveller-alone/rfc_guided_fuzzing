--- Section: 2.2. Lexical Analysis of Messages_Header Fields ---
Header fields are lines beginning with a field name, followed by a
   colon (":"), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A
   field name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
   characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
   colon.  A field body may be composed of printable US-ASCII characters
   as well as the space (SP, ASCII value 32) and horizontal tab (HTAB,
   ASCII value 9) characters (together known as the white space
   characters, WSP).  A field body MUST NOT include CR and LF except
   when used in "folding" and "unfolding", as described in section
   2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in
   sections 3 and 4 of this specification.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
