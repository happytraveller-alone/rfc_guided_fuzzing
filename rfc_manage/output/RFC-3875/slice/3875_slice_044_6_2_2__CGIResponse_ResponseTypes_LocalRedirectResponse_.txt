CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.2.2. CGIResponse_ResponseTypes_LocalRedirectResponse_ ---
The CGI script can return a URI path and query-string
   ('local-pathquery') for a local resource in a Location header field.
   This indicates to the server that it should reprocess the request
   using the path specified.

      local-redir-response = local-Location NL

   The script MUST NOT return any other header fields or a message-body,
   and the server MUST generate the response that it would have produced
   in response to a request containing the URL

      scheme "://" server-name ":" server-port local-pathquery

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
