--- Section: 3.3. InvokingtheScript_TheScriptURI_ ---
The mapping from client request URI to choice of script is defined by
   the particular server implementation and its configuration.  The
   server may allow the script to be identified with a set of several
   different URI path hierarchies, and therefore is permitted to replace
   the URI by other members of this set during processing and generation
   of the meta-variables.  The server

      1. MAY preserve the URI in the particular client request; or

      2. it MAY select a canonical URI from the set of possible values
         for each script; or

      3. it can implement any other selection of URI from the set.

   From the meta-variables thus generated, a URI, the 'Script-URI', can
   be constructed.  This MUST have the property that if the client had
   accessed this URI instead, then the script would have been executed
   with the same values for the SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING
   meta-variables.  The Script-URI has the structure of a generic URI as
   defined in section 3 of RFC 2396 [2], with the exception that object
   parameters and fragment identifiers are not permitted.  The various
   components of the Script-URI are defined by some of the
   meta-variables (see below);

      script-URI = <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port>
                   <script-path> <extra-path> "?" <query-string>

   where <scheme> is found from SERVER_PROTOCOL, <server-name>,
   <server-port> and <query-string> are the values of the respective
   meta-variables.  The SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO values, URL-encoded
   with ";", "=" and "?"  reserved, give <script-path> and <extra-path>.

   See section 4.1.5 for more information about the PATH_INFO
   meta-variable.

   The scheme and the protocol are not identical as the scheme
   identifies the access method in addition to the application protocol.
   For example, a resource accessed using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [14] would have a request URI with a scheme of https when using the
   HTTP protocol [19].  CGI/1.1 provides no generic means for the script
   to reconstruct this, and therefore the Script-URI as defined includes
   the base protocol used.  However, a script MAY make use of
   scheme-specific meta-variables to better deduce the URI scheme.

   Note that this definition also allows URIs to be constructed which
   would invoke the script with any permitted values for the path-info
   or query-string, by modifying the appropriate components.
