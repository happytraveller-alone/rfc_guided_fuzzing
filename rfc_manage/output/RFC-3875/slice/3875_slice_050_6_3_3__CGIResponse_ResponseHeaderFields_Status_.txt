--- Section: 6.3.3. CGIResponse_ResponseHeaderFields_Status_ ---
The Status header field contains a 3-digit integer result code that
   indicates the level of success of the script's attempt to handle the
   request.

      Status         = "Status:" status-code SP reason-phrase NL
      status-code    = "200" | "302" | "400" | "501" | extension-code
      extension-code = 3digit
      reason-phrase  = *TEXT

   Status code 200 'OK' indicates success, and is the default value
   assumed for a document response.  Status code 302 'Found' is used
   with a Location header field and response message-body.  Status code

   400 'Bad Request' may be used for an unknown request format, such as
   a missing CONTENT_TYPE.  Status code 501 'Not Implemented' may be
   returned by a script if it receives an unsupported REQUEST_METHOD.

   Other valid status codes are listed in section 6.1.1 of the HTTP
   specifications [1], [4], and also the IANA HTTP Status Code Registry
   [8] and MAY be used in addition to or instead of the ones listed
   above.  The script SHOULD check the value of SERVER_PROTOCOL before
   using HTTP/1.1 status codes.  The script MAY reject with error 405
   'Method Not Allowed' HTTP/1.1 requests made using a method it does
   not support.

   Note that returning an error status code does not have to mean an
   error condition with the script itself.  For example, a script that
   is invoked as an error handler by the server should return the code
   appropriate to the server's error condition.

   The reason-phrase is a textual description of the error to be
   returned to the client for human consumption.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
