--- Section: 4.1.4. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_GATEWAY_INTERFACE_ ---
The GATEWAY_INTERFACE variable MUST be set to the dialect of CGI
   being used by the server to communicate with the script.  Syntax:

      GATEWAY_INTERFACE = "CGI" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit

   Note that the major and minor numbers are treated as separate
   integers and hence each may be incremented higher than a single
   digit.  Thus CGI/2.4 is a lower version than CGI/2.13 which in turn
   is lower than CGI/12.3.  Leading zeros MUST be ignored by the script
   and MUST NOT be generated by the server.

   This document defines the 1.1 version of the CGI interface.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
