--- Section: 3.2. InvokingtheScript_ScriptSelection_ ---
The server determines which CGI is script to be executed based on a
   generic-form URI supplied by the client.  This URI includes a
   hierarchical path with components separated by "/".  For any
   particular request, the server will identify all or a leading part of
   this path with an individual script, thus placing the script at a
   particular point in the path hierarchy.  The remainder of the path,
   if any, is a resource or sub-resource identifier to be interpreted by
   the script.

   Information about this split of the path is available to the script
   in the meta-variables, described below.  Support for non-hierarchical
   URI schemes is outside the scope of this specification.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
]
