--- Section: 4.1. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_ ---
Meta-variables contain data about the request passed from the server
   to the script, and are accessed by the script in a system-defined
   manner.  Meta-variables are identified by case-insensitive names;
   there cannot be two different variables whose names differ in case
   only.  Here they are shown using a canonical representation of
   capitals plus underscore ("_").  A particular system can define a
   different representation.

      meta-variable-name = "AUTH_TYPE" | "CONTENT_LENGTH" |
                           "CONTENT_TYPE" | "GATEWAY_INTERFACE" |
                           "PATH_INFO" | "PATH_TRANSLATED" |
                           "QUERY_STRING" | "REMOTE_ADDR" |
                           "REMOTE_HOST" | "REMOTE_IDENT" |
                           "REMOTE_USER" | "REQUEST_METHOD" |
                           "SCRIPT_NAME" | "SERVER_NAME" |
                           "SERVER_PORT" | "SERVER_PROTOCOL" |
                           "SERVER_SOFTWARE" | scheme |
                           protocol-var-name | extension-var-name
      protocol-var-name  = ( protocol | scheme ) "_" var-name
      scheme             = alpha *( alpha | digit | "+" | "-" | "." )
      var-name           = token
      extension-var-name = token

   Meta-variables with the same name as a scheme, and names beginning
   with the name of a protocol or scheme (e.g., HTTP_ACCEPT) are also
   defined.  The number and meaning of these variables may change
   independently of this specification.  (See also section 4.1.18.)

   The server MAY set additional implementation-defined extension meta-
   variables, whose names SHOULD be prefixed with "X_".

   This specification does not distinguish between zero-length (NULL)
   values and missing values.  For example, a script cannot distinguish
   between the two requests http://host/script and http://host/script?
   as in both cases the QUERY_STRING meta-variable would be NULL.

      meta-variable-value = "" | 1*<TEXT, CHAR or tokens of value>

   An optional meta-variable may be omitted (left unset) if its value is
   NULL.  Meta-variable values MUST be considered case-sensitive except
   as noted otherwise.  The representation of the characters in the
   meta-variables is system-defined; the server MUST convert values to
   that representation.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
