--- Section: 4.1.7. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_QUERY_STRING_ ---
The QUERY_STRING variable contains a URL-encoded search or parameter
   string; it provides information to the CGI script to affect or refine
   the document to be returned by the script.

   The URL syntax for a search string is described in section 3 of RFC
   2396 [2].  The QUERY_STRING value is case-sensitive.

      QUERY_STRING = query-string
      query-string = *uric
      uric         = reserved | unreserved | escaped

   When parsing and decoding the query string, the details of the
   parsing, reserved characters and support for non US-ASCII characters
   depends on the context.  For example, form submission from an HTML
   document [18] uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding, in
   which the characters "+", "&" and "=" are reserved, and the ISO
   8859-1 encoding may be used for non US-ASCII characters.

   The QUERY_STRING value provides the query-string part of the
   Script-URI.  (See section 3.3).

   The server MUST set this variable; if the Script-URI does not include
   a query component, the QUERY_STRING MUST be defined as an empty
   string ("").

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
