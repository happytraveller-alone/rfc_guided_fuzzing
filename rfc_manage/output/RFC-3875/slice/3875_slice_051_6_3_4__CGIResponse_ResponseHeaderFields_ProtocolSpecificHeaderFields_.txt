--- Section: 6.3.4. CGIResponse_ResponseHeaderFields_ProtocolSpecificHeaderFields_ ---
The script MAY return any other header fields that relate to the
   response message defined by the specification for the SERVER_PROTOCOL
   (HTTP/1.0 [1] or HTTP/1.1 [4]).  The server MUST translate the header
   data from the CGI header syntax to the HTTP header syntax if these
   differ.  For example, the character sequence for newline (such as
   UNIX's US-ASCII LF) used by CGI scripts may not be the same as that
   used by HTTP (US-ASCII CR followed by LF).

   The script MUST NOT return any header fields that relate to
   client-side communication issues and could affect the server's
   ability to send the response to the client.  The server MAY remove
   any such header fields returned by the client.  It SHOULD resolve any
   conflicts between header fields returned by the script and header
   fields that it would otherwise send itself.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
