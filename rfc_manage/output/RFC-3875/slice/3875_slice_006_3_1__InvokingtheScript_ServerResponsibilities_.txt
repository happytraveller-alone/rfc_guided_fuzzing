--- Section: 3.1. InvokingtheScript_ServerResponsibilities_ ---
The server acts as an application gateway.  It receives the request
   from the client, selects a CGI script to handle the request, converts
   the client request to a CGI request, executes the script and converts
   the CGI response into a response for the client.  When processing the
   client request, it is responsible for implementing any protocol or
   transport level authentication and security.  The server MAY also
   function in a 'non-transparent' manner, modifying the request or
   response in order to provide some additional service, such as media
   type transformation or protocol reduction.

   The server MUST perform translations and protocol conversions on the
   client request data required by this specification.  Furthermore, the
   server retains its responsibility to the client to conform to the
   relevant network protocol even if the CGI script fails to conform to
   this specification.

   If the server is applying authentication to the request, then it MUST
   NOT execute the script unless the request passes all defined access
   controls.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
