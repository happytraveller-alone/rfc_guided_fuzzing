--- Section: 6.3.2. CGIResponse_ResponseHeaderFields_Location_ ---
The Location header field is used to specify to the server that the
   script is returning a reference to a document rather than an actual
   document (see sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4).  It is either an absolute
   URI (optionally with a fragment identifier), indicating that the
   client is to fetch the referenced document, or a local URI path
   (optionally with a query string), indicating that the server is to
   fetch the referenced document and return it to the client as the
   response.

      Location        = local-Location | client-Location
      client-Location = "Location:" fragment-URI NL
      local-Location  = "Location:" local-pathquery NL
      fragment-URI    = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]
      fragment        = *uric
      local-pathquery = abs-path [ "?" query-string ]
      abs-path        = "/" path-segments
      path-segments   = segment *( "/" segment )
      segment         = *pchar
      pchar           = unreserved | escaped | extra
      extra           = ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

   The syntax of an absoluteURI is incorporated into this document from
   that specified in RFC 2396 [2] and RFC 2732 [7].  A valid absoluteURI
   always starts with the name of scheme followed by ":"; scheme names
   start with a letter and continue with alphanumerics, "+", "-" or ".".
   The local URI path and query must be an absolute path, and not a
   relative path or NULL, and hence must start with a "/".

   Note that any message-body attached to the request (such as for a
   POST request) may not be available to the resource that is the target
   of the redirect.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
