--- Section: 5.2. NPHScripts_NPHResponse_ ---
There MUST be a system-defined method for the script to send data
   back to the server or client; a script MUST always return some data.
   Unless defined otherwise, this will be the same as for conventional
   CGI scripts.

   Currently, NPH scripts are only defined for HTTP client requests.  An
   (HTTP) NPH script MUST return a complete HTTP response message,
   currently described in section 6 of the HTTP specifications [1], [4].
   The script MUST use the SERVER_PROTOCOL variable to determine the
   appropriate format for a response.  It MUST also take account of any
   generic or protocol-specific meta-variables in the request as might
   be mandated by the particular protocol specification.

   The server MUST ensure that the script output is sent to the client
   unmodified.  Note that this requires the script to use the correct
   character set (US-ASCII [9] and ISO 8859-1 [10] for HTTP) in the
   header fields.  The server SHOULD attempt to ensure that the script
   output is sent directly to the client, with minimal internal and no
   transport-visible buffering.

   Unless the implementation defines otherwise, the script MUST NOT
   indicate in its response that the client can send further requests
   over the same connection.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
