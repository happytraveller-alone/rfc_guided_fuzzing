--- Section: 4.1.6. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_PATH_TRANSLATED_ ---
The PATH_TRANSLATED variable is derived by taking the PATH_INFO
   value, parsing it as a local URI in its own right, and performing any
   virtual-to-physical translation appropriate to map it onto the
   server's document repository structure.  The set of characters
   permitted in the result is system-defined.

      PATH_TRANSLATED = *<any character>

   This is the file location that would be accessed by a request for

      <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port> <extra-path>

   where <scheme> is the scheme for the original client request and
   <extra-path> is a URL-encoded version of PATH_INFO, with ";", "=" and
   "?"  reserved.  For example, a request such as the following:

      http://somehost.com/cgi-bin/somescript/this%2eis%2epath%3binfo

   would result in a PATH_INFO value of

      /this.is.the.path;info

   An internal URI is constructed from the scheme, server location and
   the URL-encoded PATH_INFO:

      http://somehost.com/this.is.the.path%3binfo

   This would then be translated to a location in the server's document
   repository, perhaps a filesystem path something like this:

      /usr/local/www/htdocs/this.is.the.path;info

   The value of PATH_TRANSLATED is the result of the translation.

   The value is derived in this way irrespective of whether it maps to a
   valid repository location.  The server MUST preserve the case of the
   extra-path segment unless the underlying repository supports case-
   insensitive names.  If the repository is only case-aware, case-
   preserving, or case-blind with regard to document names, the server
   is not required to preserve the case of the original segment through
   the translation.

   The translation algorithm the server uses to derive PATH_TRANSLATED
   is implementation-defined; CGI scripts which use this variable may
   suffer limited portability.

   The server SHOULD set this meta-variable if the request URI includes
   a path-info component.  If PATH_INFO is NULL, then the
   PATH_TRANSLATED variable MUST be set to NULL (or unset).

Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer.
