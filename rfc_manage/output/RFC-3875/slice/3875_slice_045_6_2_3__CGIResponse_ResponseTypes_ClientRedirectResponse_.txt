--- Section: 6.2.3. CGIResponse_ResponseTypes_ClientRedirectResponse_ ---
The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field, to indicate to the client that it should reprocess the request
   using the URI specified.

      client-redir-response = client-Location *extension-field NL

   The script MUST not provide any other header fields, except for
   server-defined CGI extension fields.  For an HTTP client request, the
   server MUST generate a 302 'Found' HTTP response message.
