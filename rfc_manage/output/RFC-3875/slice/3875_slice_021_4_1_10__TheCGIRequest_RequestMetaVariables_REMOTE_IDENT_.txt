--- Section: 4.1.10. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_REMOTE_IDENT_ ---
The REMOTE_IDENT variable MAY be used to provide identity information
   reported about the connection by an RFC 1413 [20] request to the
   remote agent, if available.  The server may choose not to support
   this feature, or not to request the data for efficiency reasons, or
   not to return available identity data.

      REMOTE_IDENT = *TEXT

   The data returned may be used for authentication purposes, but the
   level of trust reposed in it should be minimal.
