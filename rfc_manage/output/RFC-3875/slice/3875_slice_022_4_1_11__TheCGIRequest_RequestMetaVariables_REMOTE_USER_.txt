--- Section: 4.1.11. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_REMOTE_USER_ ---
The REMOTE_USER variable provides a user identification string
   supplied by client as part of user authentication.

      REMOTE_USER = *TEXT

   If the client request required HTTP Authentication [5] (e.g., the
   AUTH_TYPE meta-variable is set to "Basic" or "Digest"), then the
   value of the REMOTE_USER meta-variable MUST be set to the user-ID
   supplied.
