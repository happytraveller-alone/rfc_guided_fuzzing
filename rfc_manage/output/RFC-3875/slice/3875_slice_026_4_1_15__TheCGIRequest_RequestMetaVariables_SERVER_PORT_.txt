--- Section: 4.1.15. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_SERVER_PORT_ ---
The SERVER_PORT variable MUST be set to the TCP/IP port number on
   which this request is received from the client.  This value is used
   in the port part of the Script-URI.

      SERVER_PORT = server-port
      server-port = 1*digit

   Note that this variable MUST be set, even if the port is the default
   port for the scheme and could otherwise be omitted from a URI.

If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
