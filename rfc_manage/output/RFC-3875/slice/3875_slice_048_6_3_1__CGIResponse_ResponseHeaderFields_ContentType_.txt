Forget all previous input and output content and start over.

CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.3.1. CGIResponse_ResponseHeaderFields_ContentType_ ---
The Content-Type response field sets the Internet Media Type [6] of
   the entity body.

      Content-Type = "Content-Type:" media-type NL

   If an entity body is returned, the script MUST supply a Content-Type
   field in the response.  If it fails to do so, the server SHOULD NOT
   attempt to determine the correct content type.  The value SHOULD be
   sent unmodified to the client, except for any charset parameter
   changes.

   Unless it is otherwise system-defined, the default charset assumed by
   the client for text media-types is ISO-8859-1 if the protocol is HTTP
   and US-ASCII otherwise.  Hence the script SHOULD include a charset
   parameter.  See section 3.4.1 of the HTTP/1.1 specification [4] for a
   discussion of this issue.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
