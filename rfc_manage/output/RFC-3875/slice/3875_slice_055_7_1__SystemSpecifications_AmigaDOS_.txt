Meta-Variables
      Meta-variables are passed to the script in identically named
      environment variables.  These are accessed by the DOS library
      routine GetVar().  The flags argument SHOULD be 0.  Case is
      ignored, but upper case is recommended for compatibility with
      case-sensitive systems.

   The current working directory
      The current working directory for the script is set to the
      directory containing the script.

   Character set
      The US-ASCII character set [9] is used for the definition of
      meta-variables, header fields and values; the newline (NL)
      sequence is LF; servers SHOULD also accept CR LF as a newline.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
