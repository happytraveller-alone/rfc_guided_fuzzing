CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.3.2. TheCGIRequest_RequestMethods_POST_ ---
The POST method is used to request the script perform processing and
   produce a document based on the data in the request message-body, in
   addition to meta-variable values.  A common use is form submission in
   HTML [18], intended to initiate processing by the script that has a
   permanent affect, such a change in a database.

   The script MUST check the value of the CONTENT_LENGTH variable before
   reading the attached message-body, and SHOULD check the CONTENT_TYPE
   value before processing it.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
