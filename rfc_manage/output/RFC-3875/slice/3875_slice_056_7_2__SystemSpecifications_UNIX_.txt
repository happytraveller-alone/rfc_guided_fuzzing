--- Section: 7.2. SystemSpecifications_UNIX_ ---
For UNIX compatible operating systems, the following are defined:

   Meta-Variables
      Meta-variables are passed to the script in identically named
      environment variables.  These are accessed by the C library
      routine getenv() or variable environ.

   The command line
      This is accessed using the argc and argv arguments to main().  The
      words have any characters which are 'active' in the Bourne shell
      escaped with a backslash.

   The current working directory
      The current working directory for the script SHOULD be set to the
      directory containing the script.

   Character set
      The US-ASCII character set [9], excluding NUL, is used for the
      definition of meta-variables, header fields and CHAR values; TEXT
      values use ISO-8859-1.  The PATH_TRANSLATED value can contain any
      8-bit byte except NUL.  The newline (NL) sequence is LF; servers
      should also accept CR LF as a newline.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
