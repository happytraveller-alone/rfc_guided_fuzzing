CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.2.4. CGIResponse_ResponseTypes_ClientRedirectResponsewithDocument_ ---
The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field together with an attached document, to indicate to the client
   that it should reprocess the request using the URI specified.

      client-redirdoc-response = client-Location Status Content-Type
                                 *other-field NL response-body

   The Status header field MUST be supplied and MUST contain a status
   value of 302 'Found', or it MAY contain an extension-code, that is,
   another valid status code that means client redirection.  The server
   MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's output to
   ensure that the response to the client complies with the response
   protocol version.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
