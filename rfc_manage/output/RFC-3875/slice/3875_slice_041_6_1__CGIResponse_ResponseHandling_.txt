CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.1. CGIResponse_ResponseHandling_ ---
A script MUST always provide a non-empty response, and so there is a
   system-defined method for it to send this data back to the server.
   Unless defined otherwise, this will be via the 'standard output' file
   descriptor.

   The script MUST check the REQUEST_METHOD variable when processing the
   request and preparing its response.

   The server MAY implement a timeout period within which data must be
   received from the script.  If a server implementation defines such a
   timeout and receives no data from a script within the timeout period,
   the server MAY terminate the script process.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
