--- Section: 5.1. NPHScripts_Identification_ ---
The server MAY support NPH (Non-Parsed Header) scripts; these are
   scripts to which the server passes all responsibility for response
   processing.

   This specification provides no mechanism for an NPH script to be
   identified on the basis of its output data alone.  By convention,
   therefore, any particular script can only ever provide output of one
   type (NPH or CGI) and hence the script itself is described as an 'NPH
   script'.  A server with NPH support MUST provide an implementation-
   defined mechanism for identifying NPH scripts, perhaps based on the
   name or location of the script.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
