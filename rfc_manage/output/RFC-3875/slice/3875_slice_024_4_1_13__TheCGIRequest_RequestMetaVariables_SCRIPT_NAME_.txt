CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.1.13. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_SCRIPT_NAME_ ---
The SCRIPT_NAME variable MUST be set to a URI path (not URL-encoded)
   which could identify the CGI script (rather than the script's
   output).  The syntax is the same as for PATH_INFO (section 4.1.5)

      SCRIPT_NAME = "" | ( "/" path )

   The leading "/" is not part of the path.  It is optional if the path
   is NULL; however, the variable MUST still be set in that case.

   The SCRIPT_NAME string forms some leading part of the path component
   of the Script-URI derived in some implementation-defined manner.  No
   PATH_INFO segment (see section 4.1.5) is included in the SCRIPT_NAME
   value.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
