CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.2. TheCGIRequest_RequestMessageBody_ ---
Request data is accessed by the script in a system-defined method;
   unless defined otherwise, this will be by reading the 'standard
   input' file descriptor or file handle.

      Request-Data   = [ request-body ] [ extension-data ]
      request-body   = <CONTENT_LENGTH>OCTET
      extension-data = *OCTET

   A request-body is supplied with the request if the CONTENT_LENGTH is
   not NULL.  The server MUST make at least that many bytes available
   for the script to read.  The server MAY signal an end-of-file
   condition after CONTENT_LENGTH bytes have been read or it MAY supply
   extension data.  Therefore, the script MUST NOT attempt to read more
   than CONTENT_LENGTH bytes, even if more data is available.  However,
   it is not obliged to read any of the data.

   For non-parsed header (NPH) scripts (section 5), the server SHOULD
   attempt to ensure that the data supplied to the script is precisely
   as supplied by the client and is unaltered by the server.

   As transfer-codings are not supported on the request-body, the server
   MUST remove any such codings from the message-body, and recalculate
   the CONTENT_LENGTH.  If this is not possible (for example, because of
   large buffering requirements), the server SHOULD reject the client
   request.  It MAY also remove content-codings from the message-body.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
