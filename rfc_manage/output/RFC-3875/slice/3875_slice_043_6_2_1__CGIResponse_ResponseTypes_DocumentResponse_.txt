CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.2.1. CGIResponse_ResponseTypes_DocumentResponse_ ---
The CGI script can return a document to the user in a document
   response, with an optional error code indicating the success status
   of the response.

      document-response = Content-Type [ Status ] *other-field NL
                          response-body

   The script MUST return a Content-Type header field.  A Status header
   field is optional, and status 200 'OK' is assumed if it is omitted.
   The server MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's
   output to ensure that the response to the client complies with the
   response protocol version.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
