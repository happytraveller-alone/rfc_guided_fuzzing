--- Section: 4.1.16. TheCGIRequest_RequestMetaVariables_SERVER_PROTOCOL_ ---
The SERVER_PROTOCOL variable MUST be set to the name and version of
   the application protocol used for this CGI request.  This MAY differ
   from the protocol version used by the server in its communication
   with the client.

      SERVER_PROTOCOL   = HTTP-Version | "INCLUDED" | extension-version
      HTTP-Version      = "HTTP" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit
      extension-version = protocol [ "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit ]
      protocol          = token

   Here, 'protocol' defines the syntax of some of the information
   passing between the server and the script (the 'protocol-specific'
   features).  It is not case sensitive and is usually presented in
   upper case.  The protocol is not the same as the scheme part of the
   script URI, which defines the overall access mechanism used by the
   client to communicate with the server.  For example, a request that
   reaches the script with a protocol of "HTTP" may have used an "https"
   scheme.

   A well-known value for SERVER_PROTOCOL which the server MAY use is
   "INCLUDED", which signals that the current document is being included
   as part of a composite document, rather than being the direct target
   of the client request.  The script should treat this as an HTTP/1.0
   request.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
