CONTENT:<
--- Section: 6.2. CGIResponse_ResponseTypes_ ---
The response comprises a message-header and a message-body, separated
   by a blank line.  The message-header contains one or more header
   fields.  The body may be NULL.

      generic-response = 1*header-field NL [ response-body ]

   The script MUST return one of either a document response, a local
   redirect response or a client redirect (with optional document)
   response.  In the response definitions below, the order of header
   fields in a response is not significant (despite appearing so in the
   BNF).  The header fields are defined in section 6.3.

      CGI-Response = document-response | local-redir-response |
                     client-redir-response | client-redirdoc-response

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
