--- Section: 6.4. CGIResponse_ResponseMessageBody_ ---
The response message-body is an attached document to be returned to
   the client by the server.  The server MUST read all the data provided
   by the script, until the script signals the end of the message-body
   by way of an end-of-file condition.  The message-body SHOULD be sent
   unmodified to the client, except for HEAD requests or any required
   transfer-codings, content-codings or charset conversions.

      response-body = *OCTET

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
	...
