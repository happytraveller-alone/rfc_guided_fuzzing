--- Section: 7.4.9. TheTLSHandshakingProtocols_HandshakeProtocol_Finished_ ---
When this message will be sent:

      A Finished message is always sent immediately after a change
      cipher spec message to verify that the key exchange and
      authentication processes were successful.  It is essential that a
      change cipher spec message be received between the other handshake
      messages and the Finished message.

   Meaning of this message:

      The Finished message is the first one protected with the just
      negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.  Recipients of Finished
      messages MUST verify that the contents are correct.  Once a side
      has sent its Finished message and received and validated the
      Finished message from its peer, it may begin to send and receive
      application data over the connection.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          opaque verify_data[verify_data_length];
      } Finished;

      verify_data
         PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages))
            [0..verify_data_length-1];

      finished_label
         For Finished messages sent by the client, the string
         "client finished".  For Finished messages sent by the server,
         the string "server finished".

      Hash denotes a Hash of the handshake messages.  For the PRF
      defined in Section 5, the Hash MUST be the Hash used as the basis
      for the PRF.  Any cipher suite which defines a different PRF MUST
      also define the Hash to use in the Finished computation.

      In previous versions of TLS, the verify_data was always 12 octets
      long.  In the current version of TLS, it depends on the cipher
      suite.  Any cipher suite which does not explicitly specify
      verify_data_length has a verify_data_length equal to 12.  This
      includes all existing cipher suites.  Note that this
      representation has the same encoding as with previous versions.
      Future cipher suites MAY specify other lengths but such length
      MUST be at least 12 bytes.

      handshake_messages
         All of the data from all messages in this handshake (not
         including any HelloRequest messages) up to, but not including,
         this message.  This is only data visible at the handshake layer
         and does not include record layer headers.  This is the
         concatenation of all the Handshake structures as defined in
         Section 7.4, exchanged thus far.

   It is a fatal error if a Finished message is not preceded by a
   ChangeCipherSpec message at the appropriate point in the handshake.

   The value handshake_messages includes all handshake messages starting
   at ClientHello up to, but not including, this Finished message.  This
   may be different from handshake_messages in Section 7.4.8 because it
   would include the CertificateVerify message (if sent).  Also, the
   handshake_messages for the Finished message sent by the client will
   be different from that for the Finished message sent by the server,
   because the one that is sent second will include the prior one.

   Note: ChangeCipherSpec messages, alerts, and any other record types
   are not handshake messages and are not included in the hash
   computations.  Also, HelloRequest messages are omitted from handshake
   hashes.
