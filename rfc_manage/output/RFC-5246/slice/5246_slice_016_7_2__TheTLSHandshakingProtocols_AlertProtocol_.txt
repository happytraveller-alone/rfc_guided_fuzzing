--- Section: 7.2. TheTLSHandshakingProtocols_AlertProtocol_ ---
One of the content types supported by the TLS record layer is the
   alert type.  Alert messages convey the severity of the message
   (warning or fatal) and a description of the alert.  Alert messages
   with a level of fatal result in the immediate termination of the
   connection.  In this case, other connections corresponding to the
   session may continue, but the session identifier MUST be invalidated,
   preventing the failed session from being used to establish new
   connections.  Like other messages, alert messages are encrypted and
   compressed, as specified by the current connection state.

      enum { warning(1), fatal(2), (255) } AlertLevel;

      enum {
          close_notify(0),
          unexpected_message(10),

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
