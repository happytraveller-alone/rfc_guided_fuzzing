--- Section: 6.2.2. TheTLSRecordProtocol_RecordLayer_RecordCompressionandDecompression_ ---
All records are compressed using the compression algorithm defined in
   the current session state.  There is always an active compression
   algorithm; however, initially it is defined as
   CompressionMethod.null.  The compression algorithm translates a
   TLSPlaintext structure into a TLSCompressed structure.  Compression
   functions are initialized with default state information whenever a
   connection state is made active.  [RFC3749] describes compression
   algorithms for TLS.

   Compression must be lossless and may not increase the content length
   by more than 1024 bytes.  If the decompression function encounters a
   TLSCompressed.fragment that would decompress to a length in excess of
   2^14 bytes, it MUST report a fatal decompression failure error.

      struct {
          ContentType type;       /* same as TLSPlaintext.type */
          ProtocolVersion version;/* same as TLSPlaintext.version */
          uint16 length;
          opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];
      } TLSCompressed;

   length
      The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.
      The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.

   fragment
      The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.

      Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation;
      no fields are altered.

      Implementation note: Decompression functions are responsible for
      ensuring that messages cannot cause internal buffer overflows.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
