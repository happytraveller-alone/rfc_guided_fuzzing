When this message will be sent:

      This message is used to provide explicit verification of a client
      certificate.  This message is only sent following a client
      certificate that has signing capability (i.e., all certificates
      except those containing fixed Diffie-Hellman parameters).  When
      sent, it MUST immediately follow the client key exchange message.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
           digitally-signed struct {
               opaque handshake_messages[handshake_messages_length];
           }
      } CertificateVerify;

      Here handshake_messages refers to all handshake messages sent or
      received, starting at client hello and up to, but not including,
      this message, including the type and length fields of the
      handshake messages.  This is the concatenation of all the
      Handshake structures (as defined in Section 7.4) exchanged thus
      far.  Note that this requires both sides to either buffer the
      messages or compute running hashes for all potential hash
      algorithms up to the time of the CertificateVerify computation.
      Servers can minimize this computation cost by offering a
      restricted set of digest algorithms in the CertificateRequest
      message.

      The hash and signature algorithms used in the signature MUST be
      one of those present in the supported_signature_algorithms field
      of the CertificateRequest message.  In addition, the hash and
      signature algorithms MUST be compatible with the key in the
      client's end-entity certificate.  RSA keys MAY be used with any
      permitted hash algorithm, subject to restrictions in the
      certificate, if any.

      Because DSA signatures do not contain any secure indication of
      hash algorithm, there is a risk of hash substitution if multiple
      hashes may be used with any key.  Currently, DSA [DSS] may only be
      used with SHA-1.  Future revisions of DSS [DSS-3] are expected to
      allow the use of other digest algorithms with DSA, as well as
      guidance as to which digest algorithms should be used with each
      key size.  In addition, future revisions of [PKIX] may specify
      mechanisms for certificates to indicate which digest algorithms
      are to be used with DSA.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
