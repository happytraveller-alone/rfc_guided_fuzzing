--- Section: 8.1. CryptographicComputations_ComputingtheMasterSecret_ ---
For all key exchange methods, the same algorithm is used to convert
   the pre_master_secret into the master_secret.  The pre_master_secret
   should be deleted from memory once the master_secret has been
   computed.

      master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, "master secret",
                          ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)
                          [0..47];

   The master secret is always exactly 48 bytes in length.  The length
   of the premaster secret will vary depending on key exchange method.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
