When this message will be sent:

      This is the first message the client can send after receiving a
      ServerHelloDone message.  This message is only sent if the server
      requests a certificate.  If no suitable certificate is available,
      the client MUST send a certificate message containing no
      certificates.  That is, the certificate_list structure has a
      length of zero.  If the client does not send any certificates, the
      server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake without
      client authentication, or respond with a fatal handshake_failure
      alert.  Also, if some aspect of the certificate chain was
      unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by a known, trusted CA), the
      server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake
      (considering the client unauthenticated) or send a fatal alert.

      Client certificates are sent using the Certificate structure
      defined in Section 7.4.2.

   Meaning of this message:

      This message conveys the client's certificate chain to the server;
      the server will use it when verifying the CertificateVerify
      message (when the client authentication is based on signing) or
      calculating the premaster secret (for non-ephemeral Diffie-
      Hellman).  The certificate MUST be appropriate for the negotiated
      cipher suite's key exchange algorithm, and any negotiated
      extensions.

   In particular:

   -  The certificate type MUST be X.509v3, unless explicitly negotiated
      otherwise (e.g., [TLSPGP]).

   -  The end-entity certificate's public key (and associated
      restrictions) has to be compatible with the certificate types
      listed in CertificateRequest:

      Client Cert. Type   Certificate Key Type

      rsa_sign            RSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
                          key to be used for signing with the signature
                          scheme and hash algorithm that will be
                          employed in the certificate verify message.

      dss_sign            DSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
                          key to be used for signing with the hash
                          algorithm that will be employed in the
                          certificate verify message.

      ecdsa_sign          ECDSA-capable public key; the certificate MUST
                          allow the key to be used for signing with the
                          hash algorithm that will be employed in the
                          certificate verify message; the public key
                          MUST use a curve and point format supported by
                          the server.

      rsa_fixed_dh        Diffie-Hellman public key; MUST use the same
      dss_fixed_dh        parameters as server's key.

      rsa_fixed_ecdh      ECDH-capable public key; MUST use the
      ecdsa_fixed_ecdh    same curve as the server's key, and MUST use a
                          point format supported by the server.

   -  If the certificate_authorities list in the certificate request
      message was non-empty, one of the certificates in the certificate
      chain SHOULD be issued by one of the listed CAs.

   -  The certificates MUST be signed using an acceptable hash/
      signature algorithm pair, as described in Section 7.4.4.  Note
      that this relaxes the constraints on certificate-signing
      algorithms found in prior versions of TLS.

   Note that, as with the server certificate, there are certificates
   that use algorithms/algorithm combinations that cannot be currently
   used with TLS.
