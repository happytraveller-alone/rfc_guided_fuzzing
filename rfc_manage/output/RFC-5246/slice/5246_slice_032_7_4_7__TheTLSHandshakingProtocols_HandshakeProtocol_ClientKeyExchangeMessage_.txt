When this message will be sent:

      This message is always sent by the client.  It MUST immediately
      follow the client certificate message, if it is sent.  Otherwise,
      it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives
      the ServerHelloDone message.

   Meaning of this message:

      With this message, the premaster secret is set, either by direct
      transmission of the RSA-encrypted secret or by the transmission of
      Diffie-Hellman parameters that will allow each side to agree upon
      the same premaster secret.

      When the client is using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent,
      then this message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public
      value.  If the client is sending a certificate containing a static
      DH exponent (i.e., it is doing fixed_dh client authentication),
      then this message MUST be sent but MUST be empty.

   Structure of this message:

      The choice of messages depends on which key exchange method has
      been selected.  See Section 7.4.3 for the KeyExchangeAlgorithm
      definition.

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              case rsa:
                  EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
              case dhe_dss:
              case dhe_rsa:
              case dh_dss:
              case dh_rsa:
              case dh_anon:
                  ClientDiffieHellmanPublic;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
