When this message will be sent:

      The HelloRequest message MAY be sent by the server at any time.

   Meaning of this message:

      HelloRequest is a simple notification that the client should begin
      the negotiation process anew.  In response, the client should send
      a ClientHello message when convenient.  This message is not
      intended to establish which side is the client or server but
      merely to initiate a new negotiation.  Servers SHOULD NOT send a
      HelloRequest immediately upon the client's initial connection.  It
      is the client's job to send a ClientHello at that time.

      This message will be ignored by the client if the client is
      currently negotiating a session.  This message MAY be ignored by
      the client if it does not wish to renegotiate a session, or the
      client may, if it wishes, respond with a no_renegotiation alert.
      Since handshake messages are intended to have transmission
      precedence over application data, it is expected that the
      negotiation will begin before no more than a few records are
      received from the client.  If the server sends a HelloRequest but
      does not receive a ClientHello in response, it may close the
      connection with a fatal alert.

      After sending a HelloRequest, servers SHOULD NOT repeat the
      request until the subsequent handshake negotiation is complete.

   Structure of this message:

      struct { } HelloRequest;

   This message MUST NOT be included in the message hashes that are
   maintained throughout the handshake and used in the Finished messages
   and the certificate verify message.
