A non-anonymous server can optionally request a certificate from the
   client, if appropriate for the selected cipher suite.

        enum {
            rsa_sign(1), dss_sign(2), rsa_fixed_dh(3), dss_fixed_dh(4),
            rsa_ephemeral_dh(5), dss_ephemeral_dh(6), fortezza_kea(20),
            (255)
        } ClientCertificateType;

        opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

        struct {
            ClientCertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
            DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<3..2^16-1>;
        } CertificateRequest;

   certificate_types:  This field is a list of the types of certificates
      requested, sorted in order of the server's preference.

   certificate_authorities:  A list of the distinguished names of
      acceptable certificate authorities.

   Note: DistinguishedName is derived from [X509].

   Note: It is a fatal handshake_failure alert for an anonymous server
   to request client identification.
