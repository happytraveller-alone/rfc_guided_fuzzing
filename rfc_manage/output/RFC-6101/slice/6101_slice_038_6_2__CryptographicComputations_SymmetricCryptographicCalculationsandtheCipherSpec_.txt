The technique used to encrypt and verify the integrity of SSL records
   is specified by the currently active CipherSpec.  A typical example
   would be to encrypt data using DES and generate authentication codes
   using MD5.  The encryption and MAC algorithms are set to
   SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL at the beginning of the SSL handshake
   protocol, indicating that no message authentication or encryption is
   performed.  The handshake protocol is used to negotiate a more secure
   CipherSpec and to generate cryptographic keys.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
