CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.3. SSLProtocol_ChangeCipherSpecProtocol_ ---
The change cipher spec protocol exists to signal transitions in
   ciphering strategies.  The protocol consists of a single message,
   which is encrypted and compressed under the current (not the pending)
   CipherSpec.  The message consists of a single byte of value 1.

        struct {
            enum { change_cipher_spec(1), (255) } type;
        } ChangeCipherSpec;

   The change cipher spec message is sent by both the client and server
   to notify the receiving party that subsequent records will be
   protected under the just-negotiated CipherSpec and keys.  Reception
   of this message causes the receiver to copy the read pending state
   into the read current state.  The client sends a change cipher spec
   message following handshake key exchange and certificate verify
   messages (if any), and the server sends one after successfully
   processing the key exchange message it received from the client.  An
   unexpected change cipher spec message should generate an
   unexpected_message alert (Section 5.4.2).  When resuming a previous
   session, the change cipher spec message is sent after the hello
   messages.
