--- Section: 5.6.7.1. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_ClientKeyExchangeMessage_RSAEncryptedPremasterSecretMessage_ ---
If RSA is being used for key agreement and authentication, the client
   generates a 48-byte premaster secret, encrypts it under the public
   key from the server's certificate or temporary RSA key from a server
   key exchange message, and sends the result in an encrypted premaster
   secret message.

        struct {
            ProtocolVersion client_version;
            opaque random[46];
        } PreMasterSecret;

   client_version:  The latest (newest) version supported by the client.
      This is used to detect version roll-back attacks.

   random:  46 securely-generated random bytes.

        struct {
            public-key-encrypted PreMasterSecret pre_master_secret;
        } EncryptedPreMasterSecret;

   pre_master_secret:  This random value is generated by the client and
      is used to generate the master secret, as specified in
      Section 6.1.
