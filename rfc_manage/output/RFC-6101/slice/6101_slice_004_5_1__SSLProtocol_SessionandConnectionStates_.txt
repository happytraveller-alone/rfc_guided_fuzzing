--- Section: 5.1. SSLProtocol_SessionandConnectionStates_ ---
An SSL session is stateful.  It is the responsibility of the SSL
   handshake protocol to coordinate the states of the client and server,
   thereby allowing the protocol state machines of each to operate
   consistently, despite the fact that the state is not exactly
   parallel.  Logically, the state is represented twice, once as the
   current operating state and (during the handshake protocol) again as
   the pending state.  Additionally, separate read and write states are
   maintained.  When the client or server receives a change cipher spec
   message, it copies the pending read state into the current read
   state.  When the client or server sends a change cipher spec message,
   it copies the pending write state into the current write state.  When
   the handshake negotiation is complete, the client and server exchange
   change cipher spec messages (see Section 5.3), and they then
   communicate using the newly agreed-upon cipher spec.

   An SSL session may include multiple secure connections; in addition,
   parties may have multiple simultaneous sessions.

   The session state includes the following elements:

   session identifier:  An arbitrary byte sequence chosen by the server
      to identify an active or resumable session state.

   peer certificate:  X509.v3 [X509] certificate of the peer.  This
      element of the state may be null.

   compression method:  The algorithm used to compress data prior to
      encryption.

   cipher spec:  Specifies the bulk data encryption algorithm (such as
      null, DES, etc.) and a MAC algorithm (such as MD5 or SHA).  It
      also defines cryptographic attributes such as the hash_size.  (See
      Appendix A.7 for formal definition.)

   master secret:  48-byte secret shared between the client and server.

   is resumable:  A flag indicating whether the session can be used to
      initiate new connections.

   The connection state includes the following elements:

   server and client random:  Byte sequences that are chosen by the
      server and client for each connection.

   server write MAC secret:  The secret used in MAC operations on data
      written by the server.

   client write MAC secret:  The secret used in MAC operations on data
      written by the client.

   server write key:  The bulk cipher key for data encrypted by the
      server and decrypted by the client.

   client write key:  The bulk cipher key for data encrypted by the
      client and decrypted by the server.

   initialization vectors:  When a block cipher in Cipher Block Chaining
      (CBC) mode is used, an initialization vector (IV) is maintained
      for each key.  This field is first initialized by the SSL
      handshake protocol.  Thereafter, the final ciphertext block from
      each record is preserved for use with the following record.

   sequence numbers:  Each party maintains separate sequence numbers for
      transmitted and received messages for each connection.  When a
      party sends or receives a change cipher spec message, the
      appropriate sequence number is set to zero.  Sequence numbers are
      of type uint64 and may not exceed 2^64-1.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
