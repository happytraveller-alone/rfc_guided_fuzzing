SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5 requires five random bytes for
   each of the two encryption keys and 16 bytes for each of the MAC
   keys, for a total of 42 bytes of key material.  MD5 produces 16 bytes
   of output per call, so three calls to MD5 are required.  The MD5
   outputs are concatenated into a 48-byte key_block with the first MD5
   call providing bytes zero through 15, the second providing bytes 16
   through 31, etc.  The key_block is partitioned, and the write keys
   are salted because this is an exportable encryption algorithm.

        client_write_MAC_secret = key_block[0..15]
        server_write_MAC_secret = key_block[16..31]
        client_write_key      = key_block[32..36]
        server_write_key      = key_block[37..41]
        final_client_write_key = MD5(client_write_key +
                                     ClientHello.random +
                                     ServerHello.random)[0..15];
        final_server_write_key = MD5(server_write_key +
                                     ServerHello.random +
                                     ClientHello.random)[0..15];
        client_write_IV = MD5(ClientHello.random +
                              ServerHello.random)[0..7];
        server_write_IV = MD5(ServerHello.random +
                              ClientHello.random)[0..7];

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
