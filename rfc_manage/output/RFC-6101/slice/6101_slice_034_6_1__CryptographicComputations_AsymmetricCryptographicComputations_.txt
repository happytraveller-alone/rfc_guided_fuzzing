--- Section: 6.1. CryptographicComputations_AsymmetricCryptographicComputations_ ---
The asymmetric algorithms are used in the handshake protocol to
   authenticate parties and to generate shared keys and secrets.

   For Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and FORTEZZA, the same algorithm is used to
   convert the pre_master_secret into the master_secret.  The
   pre_master_secret should be deleted from memory once the
   master_secret has been computed.

        master_secret =
          MD5(pre_master_secret + SHA('A' + pre_master_secret +
              ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)) +
          MD5(pre_master_secret + SHA('BB' + pre_master_secret +
              ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)) +
          MD5(pre_master_secret + SHA('CCC' + pre_master_secret +
              ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random));

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
