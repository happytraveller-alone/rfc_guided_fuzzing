--- Section: 5.6. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_ ---
The SSL handshake protocol is one of the defined higher level clients
   of the SSL record protocol.  This protocol is used to negotiate the
   secure attributes of a session.  Handshake messages are supplied to
   the SSL record layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more
   SSLPlaintext structures, which are processed and transmitted as
   specified by the current active session state.

        enum {
            hello_request(0), client_hello(1), server_hello(2),
            certificate(11), server_key_exchange (12),
            certificate_request(13), server_hello_done(14),
            certificate_verify(15), client_key_exchange(16),
            finished(20), (255)
        } HandshakeType;

        struct {
            HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
            uint24 length;             /* bytes in message */
            select (HandshakeType) {
                case hello_request: HelloRequest;
                case client_hello: ClientHello;
                case server_hello: ServerHello;
                case certificate: Certificate;
                case server_key_exchange: ServerKeyExchange;
                case certificate_request: CertificateRequest;
                case server_hello_done: ServerHelloDone;
                case certificate_verify: CertificateVerify;
                case client_key_exchange: ClientKeyExchange;
                case finished: Finished;
            } body;
        } Handshake;

   The handshake protocol messages are presented in the order they must
   be sent; sending handshake messages in an unexpected order results in
   a fatal error.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
