--- Section: 5.6.1.2. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_Hellomessages_ClientHello_ ---
When a client first connects to a server it is required to send the
   client hello as its first message.  The client can also send a client
   hello in response to a hello request or on its own initiative in
   order to renegotiate the security parameters in an existing
   connection.  The client hello message includes a random structure,
   which is used later in the protocol.

      struct {
          uint32 gmt_unix_time;
          opaque random_bytes[28];
      } Random;

   gmt_unix_time:  The current time and date in standard UNIX 32-bit
      format according to the sender's internal clock.  Clocks are not
      required to be set correctly by the basic SSL protocol; higher
      level or application protocols may define additional requirements.

   random_bytes:  28 bytes generated by a secure random number
      generator.

   The client hello message includes a variable-length session
   identifier.  If not empty, the value identifies a session between the
   same client and server whose security parameters the client wishes to
   reuse.  The session identifier may be from an earlier connection,
   this connection, or another currently active connection.  The second
   option is useful if the client only wishes to update the random
   structures and derived values of a connection, while the third option
   makes it possible to establish several simultaneous independent
   secure connections without repeating the full handshake protocol.
   The actual contents of the SessionID are defined by the server.

        opaque SessionID<0..32>;

   Warning: Servers must not place confidential information in session
   identifiers or let the contents of fake session identifiers cause any
   breach of security.

   The CipherSuite list, passed from the client to the server in the
   client hello message, contains the combinations of cryptographic
   algorithms supported by the client in order of the client's
   preference (first choice first).  Each CipherSuite defines both a key
   exchange algorithm and a CipherSpec.  The server will select a cipher
   suite or, if no acceptable choices are presented, return a handshake
   failure alert and close the connection.

        uint8 CipherSuite[2];  /* Cryptographic suite selector */

   The client hello includes a list of compression algorithms supported
   by the client, ordered according to the client's preference.  If the
   server supports none of those specified by the client, the session
   must fail.

        enum { null(0), (255) } CompressionMethod;

   Issue: Which compression methods to support is under investigation.

   The structure of the client hello is as follows.

        struct {
            ProtocolVersion client_version;
            Random random;
            SessionID session_id;
            CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
            CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
        } ClientHello;

   client_version:  The version of the SSL protocol by which the client
      wishes to communicate during this session.  This should be the
      most recent (highest valued) version supported by the client.  For
      this version of the specification, the version will be 3.0 (see
      Appendix E for details about backward compatibility).

   random:  A client-generated random structure.

   session_id:  The ID of a session the client wishes to use for this
      connection.  This field should be empty if no session_id is
      available or the client wishes to generate new security
      parameters.

   cipher_suites:  This is a list of the cryptographic options supported
      by the client, sorted with the client's first preference first.
      If the session_id field is not empty (implying a session
      resumption request), this vector must include at least the
      cipher_suite from that session.  Values are defined in
      Appendix A.6.

   compression_methods:  This is a list of the compression methods
      supported by the client, sorted by client preference.  If the
      session_id field is not empty (implying a session resumption
      request), this vector must include at least the compression_method
      from that session.  All implementations must support
      CompressionMethod.null.

   After sending the client hello message, the client waits for a server
   hello message.  Any other handshake message returned by the server
   except for a hello request is treated as a fatal error.

   Implementation note: Application data may not be sent before a
   finished message has been sent.  Transmitted application data is
   known to be insecure until a valid finished message has been
   received.  This absolute restriction is relaxed if there is a
   current, non-null encryption on this connection.

   Forward compatibility note: In the interests of forward
   compatibility, it is permitted for a client hello message to include
   extra data after the compression methods.  This data must be included
   in the handshake hashes, but must otherwise be ignored.
