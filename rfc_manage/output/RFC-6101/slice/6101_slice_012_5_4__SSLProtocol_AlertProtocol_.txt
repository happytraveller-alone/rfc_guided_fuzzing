CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.4. SSLProtocol_AlertProtocol_ ---
One of the content types supported by the SSL record layer is the
   alert type.  Alert messages convey the severity of the message and a
   description of the alert.  Alert messages with a level of fatal
   result in the immediate termination of the connection.  In this case,
   other connections corresponding to the session may continue, but the
   session identifier must be invalidated, preventing the failed session
   from being used to establish new connections.  Like other messages,
   alert messages are encrypted and compressed, as specified by the
   current connection state.

        enum { warning(1), fatal(2), (255) } AlertLevel;

        enum {
            close_notify(0),
            unexpected_message(10),
            bad_record_mac(20),
            decompression_failure(30),
            handshake_failure(40),
            no_certificate(41),
            bad_certificate(42),
            unsupported_certificate(43),
            certificate_revoked(44),
            certificate_expired(45),
            certificate_unknown(46),
            illegal_parameter (47)
            (255)
        } AlertDescription;

        struct {
            AlertLevel level;
            AlertDescription description;
        } Alert;

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
