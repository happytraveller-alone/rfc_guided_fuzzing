CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.6.6. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_ClientCertificate_ ---
This is the first message the client can send after receiving a
   server hello done message.  This message is only sent if the server
   requests a certificate.  If no suitable certificate is available, the
   client should send a no_certificate alert instead.  This alert is
   only a warning; however, the server may respond with a fatal
   handshake failure alert if client authentication is required.  Client
   certificates are sent using the certificate defined in Section 5.6.2.

   Note: Client Diffie-Hellman certificates must match the server
   specified Diffie-Hellman parameters.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
