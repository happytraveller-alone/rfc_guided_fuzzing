CONTENT:<
--- Section: 3. GoalsofThisDocument ---
The SSL protocol version 3.0 specification is intended primarily for
   readers who will be implementing the protocol and those doing
   cryptographic analysis of it.  The spec has been written with this in
   mind, and it is intended to reflect the needs of those two groups.
   For that reason, many of the algorithm-dependent data structures and
   rules are included in the body of the text (as opposed to in an
   appendix), providing easier access to them.

   This document is not intended to supply any details of service
   definition or interface definition, although it does cover select
   areas of policy as they are required for the maintenance of solid
   security.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
