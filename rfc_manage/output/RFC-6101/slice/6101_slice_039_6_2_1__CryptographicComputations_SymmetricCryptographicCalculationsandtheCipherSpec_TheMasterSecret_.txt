Before secure encryption or integrity verification can be performed
   on records, the client and server need to generate shared secret
   information known only to themselves.  This value is a 48-byte
   quantity called the master secret.  The master secret is used to
   generate keys and secrets for encryption and MAC computations.  Some
   algorithms, such as FORTEZZA, may have their own procedure for
   generating encryption keys (the master secret is used only for MAC
   computations in FORTEZZA).

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
