CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.2.2. SSLProtocol_RecordLayer_RecordCompressionandDecompression_ ---
All records are compressed using the compression algorithm defined in
   the current session state.  There is always an active compression
   algorithm; however, initially it is defined as
   CompressionMethod.null.  The compression algorithm translates an
   SSLPlaintext structure into an SSLCompressed structure.  Compression
   functions erase their state information whenever the CipherSpec is
   replaced.

   Note: The CipherSpec is part of the session state described in
   Section 5.1.  References to fields of the CipherSpec are made
   throughout this document using presentation syntax.  A more complete
   description of the CipherSpec is shown in Appendix A.7.

   Compression must be lossless and may not increase the content length
   by more than 1024 bytes.  If the decompression function encounters an
   SSLCompressed.fragment that would decompress to a length in excess of
   2^14 bytes, it should issue a fatal decompression_failure alert
   (Section 5.4.2).

        struct {
            ContentType type;       /* same as SSLPlaintext.type */
            ProtocolVersion version;/* same as SSLPlaintext.version */
            uint16 length;
            opaque fragment[SSLCompressed.length];
        } SSLCompressed;

   length:  The length (in bytes) of the following
      SSLCompressed.fragment.  The length should not exceed 2^14 + 1024.

   fragment:  The compressed form of SSLPlaintext.fragment.

   Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no
   fields are altered (see Appendix A.4.1.)

   Implementation note: Decompression functions are responsible for
   ensuring that messages cannot cause internal buffer overflows.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
