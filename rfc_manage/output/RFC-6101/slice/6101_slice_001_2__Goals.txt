--- Section: 2. Goals ---
The goals of SSL protocol version 3.0, in order of their priority,
   are:

   1.  Cryptographic security

          SSL should be used to establish a secure connection between
          two parties.

   2.  Interoperability

          Independent programmers should be able to develop applications
          utilizing SSL 3.0 that will then be able to successfully
          exchange cryptographic parameters without knowledge of one
          another's code.

          Note: It is not the case that all instances of SSL (even in
          the same application domain) will be able to successfully
          connect.  For instance, if the server supports a particular
          hardware token, and the client does not have access to such a
          token, then the connection will not succeed.

   3.  Extensibility

          SSL seeks to provide a framework into which new public key and
          bulk encryption methods can be incorporated as necessary.
          This will also accomplish two sub-goals: to prevent the need
          to create a new protocol (and risking the introduction of
          possible new weaknesses) and to avoid the need to implement an
          entire new security library.

   4.  Relative efficiency

          Cryptographic operations tend to be highly CPU intensive,
          particularly public key operations.  For this reason, the SSL
          protocol has incorporated an optional session caching scheme
          to reduce the number of connections that need to be
          established from scratch.  Additionally, care has been taken
          to reduce network activity.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
