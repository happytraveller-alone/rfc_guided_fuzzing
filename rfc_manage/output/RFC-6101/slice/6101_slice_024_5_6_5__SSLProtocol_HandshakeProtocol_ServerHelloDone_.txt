--- Section: 5.6.5. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_ServerHelloDone_ ---
The server hello done message is sent by the server to indicate the
   end of the server hello and associated messages.  After sending this
   message, the server will wait for a client response.

        struct { } ServerHelloDone;

   Upon receipt of the server hello done message the client should
   verify that the server provided a valid certificate if required and
   check that the server hello parameters are acceptable.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
