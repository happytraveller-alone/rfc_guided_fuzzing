CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.2.3. SSLProtocol_RecordLayer_RecordPayloadProtectionandtheCipherSpec_ ---
All records are protected using the encryption and MAC algorithms
   defined in the current CipherSpec.  There is always an active
   CipherSpec; however, initially it is SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL, which
   does not provide any security.

   Once the handshake is complete, the two parties have shared secrets
   that are used to encrypt records and compute keyed Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) on their contents.  The techniques used
   to perform the encryption and MAC operations are defined by the
   CipherSpec and constrained by CipherSpec.cipher_type.  The encryption
   and MAC functions translate an SSLCompressed structure into an
   SSLCiphertext.  The decryption functions reverse the process.
   Transmissions also include a sequence number so that missing,
   altered, or extra messages are detectable.

        struct {
            ContentType type;
            ProtocolVersion version;
            uint16 length;
            select (CipherSpec.cipher_type) {
                case stream: GenericStreamCipher;
                case block: GenericBlockCipher;
            } fragment;
        } SSLCiphertext;

   type:  The type field is identical to SSLCompressed.type.

   version:  The version field is identical to SSLCompressed.version.

   length:  The length (in bytes) of the following
      SSLCiphertext.fragment.  The length may not exceed 2^14 + 2048.

   fragment:  The encrypted form of SSLCompressed.fragment, including
      the MAC.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
