--- Section: 5.2.3.2. SSLProtocol_RecordLayer_RecordPayloadProtectionandtheCipherSpec_CBCBlockCipher_ ---
For block ciphers (such as RC2 or DES), the encryption and MAC
   functions convert SSLCompressed.fragment structures to and from block
   SSLCiphertext.fragment structures.

        block-ciphered struct {
            opaque content[SSLCompressed.length];
            opaque MAC[CipherSpec.hash_size];
            uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];
            uint8 padding_length;
        } GenericBlockCipher;

   The MAC is generated as described in Section 5.2.3.1.

   padding:  Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext
      to be a multiple of the block cipher's block length.

   padding_length:  The length of the padding must be less than the
      cipher's block length and may be zero.  The padding length should
      be such that the total size of the GenericBlockCipher structure is
      a multiple of the cipher's block length.

   The encrypted data length (SSLCiphertext.length) is one more than the
   sum of SSLCompressed.length, CipherSpec.hash_size, and
   padding_length.

   Note: With CBC, the initialization vector (IV) for the first record
   is provided by the handshake protocol.  The IV for subsequent records
   is the last ciphertext block from the previous record.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
