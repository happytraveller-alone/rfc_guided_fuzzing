CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.2.1. SSLProtocol_RecordLayer_Fragmentation_ ---
The record layer fragments information blocks into SSLPlaintext
   records of 2^14 bytes or less.  Client message boundaries are not
   preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
   same ContentType may be coalesced into a single SSLPlaintext record).

        struct {
            uint8 major, minor;
        } ProtocolVersion;

        enum {
            change_cipher_spec(20), alert(21), handshake(22),
            application_data(23), (255)
        } ContentType;

        struct {
            ContentType type;
            ProtocolVersion version;
            uint16 length;
            opaque fragment[SSLPlaintext.length];
        } SSLPlaintext;

   type:  The higher level protocol used to process the enclosed
      fragment.

   version:  The version of protocol being employed.  This document
      describes SSL version 3.0 (see Appendix A.1).

   length:  The length (in bytes) of the following
      SSLPlaintext.fragment.  The length should not exceed 2^14.

   fragment:  The application data.  This data is transparent and
      treated as an independent block to be dealt with by the higher
      level protocol specified by the type field.

   Note: Data of different SSL record layer content types may be
   interleaved.  Application data is generally of lower precedence for
   transmission than other content types.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
