CONTENT:<
--- Section: 5.6.1.3. SSLProtocol_HandshakeProtocol_Hellomessages_ServerHello_ ---
The server processes the client hello message and responds with
   either a handshake_failure alert or server hello message.

        struct {
            ProtocolVersion server_version;
            Random random;
            SessionID session_id;
            CipherSuite cipher_suite;
            CompressionMethod compression_method;
        } ServerHello;

   server_version:  This field will contain the lower of that suggested
      by the client in the client hello and the highest supported by the
      server.  For this version of the specification, the version will
      be 3.0 (see Appendix E for details about backward compatibility).

   random:  This structure is generated by the server and must be
      different from (and independent of) ClientHello.random.

   session_id:  This is the identity of the session corresponding to
      this connection.  If the ClientHello.session_id was non-empty, the
      server will look in its session cache for a match.  If a match is
      found and the server is willing to establish the new connection
      using the specified session state, the server will respond with
      the same value as was supplied by the client.  This indicates a
      resumed session and dictates that the parties must proceed
      directly to the finished messages.  Otherwise, this field will
      contain a different value identifying the new session.  The server
      may return an empty session_id to indicate that the session will
      not be cached and therefore cannot be resumed.

   cipher_suite:  The single cipher suite selected by the server from
      the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  For resumed sessions, this
      field is the value from the state of the session being resumed.

   compression_method:  The single compression algorithm selected by the
      server from the list in ClientHello.compression_methods.  For
      resumed sessions, this field is the value from the resumed session
      state.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
