Stream ciphers (including BulkCipherAlgorithm.null; see Appendix A.7)
   convert SSLCompressed.fragment structures to and from stream
   SSLCiphertext.fragment structures.

        stream-ciphered struct {
            opaque content[SSLCompressed.length];
            opaque MAC[CipherSpec.hash_size];
        } GenericStreamCipher;

   The MAC is generated as:

        hash(MAC_write_secret + pad_2 +
             hash(MAC_write_secret + pad_1 + seq_num +
                  SSLCompressed.type + SSLCompressed.length +
                  SSLCompressed.fragment));

   where "+" denotes concatenation.

   pad_1:  The character 0x36 repeated 48 times for MD5 or 40 times for
      SHA.

   pad_2:  The character 0x5c repeated 48 times for MD5 or 40 times for
      SHA.

   seq_num:  The sequence number for this message.

   hash:  Hashing algorithm derived from the cipher suite.

   Note that the MAC is computed before encryption.  The stream cipher
   encrypts the entire block, including the MAC.  For stream ciphers
   that do not use a synchronization vector (such as RC4), the stream
   cipher state from the end of one record is simply used on the
   subsequent packet.  If the CipherSuite is SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL,
   encryption consists of the identity operation (i.e., the data is not
   encrypted and the MAC size is zero implying that no MAC is used).
   SSLCiphertext.length is SSLCompressed.length plus
   CipherSpec.hash_size.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
