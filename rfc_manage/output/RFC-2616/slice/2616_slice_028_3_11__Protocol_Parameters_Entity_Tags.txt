--- Section: 3.11. Protocol Parameters_Entity Tags ---
Entity tags are used for comparing two or more entities from the same
   requested resource. HTTP/1.1 uses entity tags in the ETag (section
   14.19), If-Match (section 14.24), If-None-Match (section 14.26), and
   If-Range (section 14.27) header fields. The definition of how they
   are used and compared as cache validators is in section 13.3.3. An
   entity tag consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by
   a weakness indicator.

      entity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag
      weak       = "W/"
      opaque-tag = quoted-string

   A "strong entity tag" MAY be shared by two entities of a resource
   only if they are equivalent by octet equality.

   A "weak entity tag," indicated by the "W/" prefix, MAY be shared by
   two entities of a resource only if the entities are equivalent and
   could be substituted for each other with no significant change in
   semantics. A weak entity tag can only be used for weak comparison.

   An entity tag MUST be unique across all versions of all entities
   associated with a particular resource. A given entity tag value MAY
   be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs. The use
   of the same entity tag value in conjunction with entities obtained by
   requests on different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those
   entities.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
