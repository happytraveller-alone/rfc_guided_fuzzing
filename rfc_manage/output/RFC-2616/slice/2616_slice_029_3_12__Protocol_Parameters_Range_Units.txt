--- Section: 3.12. Protocol Parameters_Range Units ---
HTTP/1.1 allows a client to request that only part (a range of) the
   response entity be included within the response. HTTP/1.1 uses range
   units in the Range (section 14.35) and Content-Range (section 14.16)
   header fields. An entity can be broken down into subranges according
   to various structural units.

      range-unit       = bytes-unit | other-range-unit
      bytes-unit       = "bytes"
      other-range-unit = token

   The only range unit defined by HTTP/1.1 is "bytes". HTTP/1.1
   implementations MAY ignore ranges specified using other units.

   HTTP/1.1 has been designed to allow implementations of applications
   that do not depend on knowledge of ranges.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
