CONTENT:<
--- Section: 14.40. Header Field Definitions_Trailer ---
The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of
   header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with
   chunked transfer-coding.

       Trailer  = "Trailer" ":" 1#field-name

   An HTTP/1.1 message SHOULD include a Trailer header field in a
   message using chunked transfer-coding with a non-empty trailer. Doing
   so allows the recipient to know which header fields to expect in the
   trailer.

   If no Trailer header field is present, the trailer SHOULD NOT include
   any header fields. See section 3.6.1 for restrictions on the use of
   trailer fields in a "chunked" transfer-coding.

   Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field MUST NOT
   include the following header fields:

      . Transfer-Encoding

      . Content-Length

      . Trailer
