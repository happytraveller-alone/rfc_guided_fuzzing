CONTENT:<
--- Section: 10.2.7. Status Code Definitions_Successful 2xx_206 Partial Content ---
The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.
   The request MUST have included a Range header field (section 14.35)
   indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range
   header field (section 14.27) to make the request conditional.

   The response MUST include the following header fields:

      - Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.16) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.

      - Date

      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request

      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

   If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a
   strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT
   include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an
   If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT
   include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between
   cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response
   MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned
   with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

   A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached
   content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly,
   see 13.5.4.

   A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers
   MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
