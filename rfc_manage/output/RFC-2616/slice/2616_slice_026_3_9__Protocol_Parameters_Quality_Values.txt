CONTENT:<
--- Section: 3.9. Protocol Parameters_Quality Values ---
HTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short "floating point"
   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters.  A weight is normalized to a real number in
   the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum
   value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with
   this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1
   applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after the
   decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also be
   limited in this fashion.

       qvalue         = ( "0" [ "." 0*3DIGIT ] )
                      | ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )

   "Quality values" is a misnomer, since these values merely represent
   relative degradation in desired quality.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
