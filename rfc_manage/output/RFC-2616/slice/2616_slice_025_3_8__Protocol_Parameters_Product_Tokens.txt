CONTENT:<
--- Section: 3.8. Protocol Parameters_Product Tokens ---
Product tokens are used to allow communicating applications to
   identify themselves by software name and version. Most fields using
   product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part
   of the application to be listed, separated by white space. By
   convention, the products are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.

       product         = token ["/" product-version]
       product-version = token

   Examples:

       User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3
       Server: Apache/0.8.4

   Product tokens SHOULD be short and to the point. They MUST NOT be
   used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any
   token character MAY appear in a product-version, this token SHOULD
   only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of
   the same product SHOULD only differ in the product-version portion of
   the product value).

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
