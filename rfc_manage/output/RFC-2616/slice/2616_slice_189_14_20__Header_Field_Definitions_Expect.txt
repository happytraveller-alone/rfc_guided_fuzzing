--- Section: 14.20. Header Field Definitions_Expect ---
The Expect request-header field is used to indicate that particular
   server behaviors are required by the client.

      Expect       =  "Expect" ":" 1#expectation

      expectation  =  "100-continue" | expectation-extension
      expectation-extension =  token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string )
                               *expect-params ]
      expect-params =  ";" token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ]

   A server that does not understand or is unable to comply with any of
   the expectation values in the Expect field of a request MUST respond
   with appropriate error status. The server MUST respond with a 417
   (Expectation Failed) status if any of the expectations cannot be met
   or, if there are other problems with the request, some other 4xx
   status.

   This header field is defined with extensible syntax to allow for
   future extensions. If a server receives a request containing an
   Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not
   support, it MUST respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.

   Comparison of expectation values is case-insensitive for unquoted
   tokens (including the 100-continue token), and is case-sensitive for
   quoted-string expectation-extensions.

   The Expect mechanism is hop-by-hop: that is, an HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST
   return a 417 (Expectation Failed) status if it receives a request
   with an expectation that it cannot meet. However, the Expect
   request-header itself is end-to-end; it MUST be forwarded if the
   request is forwarded.

   Many older HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 applications do not understand the
   Expect header.

   See section 8.2.3 for the use of the 100 (continue) status.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
