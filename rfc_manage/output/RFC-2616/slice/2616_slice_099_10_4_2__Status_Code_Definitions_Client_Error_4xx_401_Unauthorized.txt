CONTENT:<
--- Section: 10.4.2. Status Code Definitions_Client Error 4xx_401 Unauthorized ---
The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a
   WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge
   applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the
   request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If
   the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401
   response indicates that authorization has been refused for those
   credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the
   prior response, and the user agent has already attempted
   authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the
   entity that was given in the response, since that entity might
   include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication
   is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access
   Authentication" [43].

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
