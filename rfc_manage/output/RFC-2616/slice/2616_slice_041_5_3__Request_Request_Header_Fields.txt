--- Section: 5.3. Request_Request Header Fields ---
The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional
   information about the request, and about the client itself, to the
   server. These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics
   equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method
   invocation.

       request-header = Accept                   ; Section 14.1
                      | Accept-Charset           ; Section 14.2
                      | Accept-Encoding          ; Section 14.3
                      | Accept-Language          ; Section 14.4
                      | Authorization            ; Section 14.8
                      | Expect                   ; Section 14.20
                      | From                     ; Section 14.22
                      | Host                     ; Section 14.23
                      | If-Match                 ; Section 14.24

                      | If-Modified-Since        ; Section 14.25
                      | If-None-Match            ; Section 14.26
                      | If-Range                 ; Section 14.27
                      | If-Unmodified-Since      ; Section 14.28
                      | Max-Forwards             ; Section 14.31
                      | Proxy-Authorization      ; Section 14.34
                      | Range                    ; Section 14.35
                      | Referer                  ; Section 14.36
                      | TE                       ; Section 14.39
                      | User-Agent               ; Section 14.43

   Request-header field names can be extended reliably only in
   combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
   experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of request-
   header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to
   be request-header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as
   entity-header fields.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
sliced_rule: [
	"topic 1": "content 1",
	"topic 2": "content 2",
