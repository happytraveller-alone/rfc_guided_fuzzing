--- Section: 2.1. Incorrect DHE Share ---
If the client has not provided a sufficient "key_share" extension
   (e.g., it includes only DHE or ECDHE groups unacceptable to or
   unsupported by the server), the server corrects the mismatch with a
   HelloRetryRequest and the client needs to restart the handshake with
   an appropriate "key_share" extension, as shown in Figure 2.  If no
   common cryptographic parameters can be negotiated, the server MUST
   abort the handshake with an appropriate alert.

        Client                                               Server

        ClientHello
        + key_share             -------->
                                                  HelloRetryRequest
                                <--------               + key_share
        ClientHello
        + key_share             -------->
                                                        ServerHello
                                                        + key_share
                                              {EncryptedExtensions}
                                              {CertificateRequest*}
                                                     {Certificate*}
                                               {CertificateVerify*}
                                                         {Finished}
                                <--------       [Application Data*]
        {Certificate*}
        {CertificateVerify*}

             Figure 2: Message Flow for a Full Handshake with
                           Mismatched Parameters

   Note: The handshake transcript incorporates the initial
   ClientHello/HelloRetryRequest exchange; it is not reset with the
   new ClientHello.

   TLS also allows several optimized variants of the basic handshake, as
   described in the following sections.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
