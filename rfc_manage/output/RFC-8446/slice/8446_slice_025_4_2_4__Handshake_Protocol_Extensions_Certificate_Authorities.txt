--- Section: 4.2.4. Handshake Protocol_Extensions_Certificate Authorities ---
The "certificate_authorities" extension is used to indicate the
   certificate authorities (CAs) which an endpoint supports and which
   SHOULD be used by the receiving endpoint to guide certificate
   selection.

   The body of the "certificate_authorities" extension consists of a
   CertificateAuthoritiesExtension structure.

      opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

      struct {
          DistinguishedName authorities<3..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateAuthoritiesExtension;

   authorities:  A list of the distinguished names [X501] of acceptable
      certificate authorities, represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.
      These distinguished names specify a desired distinguished name for
      a trust anchor or subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used
      to describe known trust anchors as well as a desired authorization
      space.

   The client MAY send the "certificate_authorities" extension in the
   ClientHello message.  The server MAY send it in the
   CertificateRequest message.

   The "trusted_ca_keys" extension [RFC6066], which serves a similar
   purpose but is more complicated, is not used in TLS 1.3 (although it
   may appear in ClientHello messages from clients which are offering
   prior versions of TLS).
