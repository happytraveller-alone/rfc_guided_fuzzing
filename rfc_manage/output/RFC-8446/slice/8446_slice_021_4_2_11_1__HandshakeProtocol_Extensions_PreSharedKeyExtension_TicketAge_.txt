CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.2.11.1. HandshakeProtocol_Extensions_PreSharedKeyExtension_TicketAge_ ---
The client's view of the age of a ticket is the time since the
   receipt of the NewSessionTicket message.  Clients MUST NOT attempt to
   use tickets which have ages greater than the "ticket_lifetime" value
   which was provided with the ticket.  The "obfuscated_ticket_age"
   field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the
   ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the
   "ticket_age_add" value that was included with the ticket (see
   Section 4.6.1), modulo 2^32.  This addition prevents passive
   observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused.
   Note that the "ticket_lifetime" field in the NewSessionTicket message
   is in seconds but the "obfuscated_ticket_age" is in milliseconds.
   Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough
   to represent any plausible age, even in milliseconds.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
