--- Section: 4.2.8.1. HandshakeProtocol_Extensions_KeyShare_DiffieHellmanParameters_ ---
Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters for both clients and servers are
   encoded in the opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a
   KeyShare structure.  The opaque value contains the Diffie-Hellman
   public value (Y = g^X mod p) for the specified group (see [RFC7919]
   for group definitions) encoded as a big-endian integer and padded to
   the left with zeros to the size of p in bytes.

   Note: For a given Diffie-Hellman group, the padding results in all
   public keys having the same length.

   Peers MUST validate each other's public key Y by ensuring that 1 < Y
   < p-1.  This check ensures that the remote peer is properly behaved
   and isn't forcing the local system into a small subgroup.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
