CONTENT:<
--- Section: 4.3.1. HandshakeProtocol_ServerParameters_EncryptedExtensions_ ---
In all handshakes, the server MUST send the EncryptedExtensions
   message immediately after the ServerHello message.  This is the first
   message that is encrypted under keys derived from the
   server_handshake_traffic_secret.

   The EncryptedExtensions message contains extensions that can be
   protected, i.e., any which are not needed to establish the
   cryptographic context but which are not associated with individual
   certificates.  The client MUST check EncryptedExtensions for the
   presence of any forbidden extensions and if any are found MUST abort
   the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
      } EncryptedExtensions;

   extensions:  A list of extensions.  For more information, see the
      table in Section 4.2.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
