--- Section: 7.2. CryptographicComputations_UpdatingTrafficSecrets_ ---
Once the handshake is complete, it is possible for either side to
   update its sending traffic keys using the KeyUpdate handshake message
   defined in Section 4.6.3.  The next generation of traffic keys is
   computed by generating client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1
   from client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N as described in this
   section and then re-deriving the traffic keys as described in
   Section 7.3.

   The next-generation application_traffic_secret is computed as:

       application_traffic_secret_N+1 =
           HKDF-Expand-Label(application_traffic_secret_N,
                             "traffic upd", "", Hash.length)

   Once client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 and its associated
   traffic keys have been computed, implementations SHOULD delete
   client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated
   traffic keys.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
