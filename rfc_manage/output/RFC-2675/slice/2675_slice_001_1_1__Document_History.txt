--- Section: 1.1. Document History ---
This document merges and updates material that was previously
   published in two separate documents:

   -  The specification of the Jumbo Payload option previously appeared
      as part of the IPv6 specification in RFC 1883.  RFC 1883 has been
      superseded by RFC 2460, which no longer includes specification of
      the Jumbo Payload option.

   -  The specification of TCP and UDP enhancements to support
      jumbograms previously appeared as RFC 2147.  RFC 2147 is obsoleted
      by this document.
