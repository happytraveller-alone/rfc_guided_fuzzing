--- Section: 3. Usage of the Jumbo Payload Option ---
The Payload Length field in the IPv6 header must be set to zero in
   every packet that carries the Jumbo Payload option.

   If a node that understands the Jumbo Payload option receives a packet
   whose IPv6 header carries a Payload Length of zero and a Next Header
   value of zero (meaning that a Hop-by-Hop Options header follows), and
   whose link-layer framing indicates the presence of octets beyond the
   IPv6 header, the node must proceed to process the Hop-by-Hop Options
   header in order to determine the actual length of the payload from
   the Jumbo Payload option.

   The Jumbo Payload option must not be used in a packet that carries a
   Fragment header.

   Higher-layer protocols that use the IPv6 Payload Length field to
   compute the value of the Upper-Layer Packet Length field in the
   checksum pseudo-header described in [IPv6, Section 8.1] must instead
   use the Jumbo Payload Length field for that computation, for packets
   that carry the Jumbo Payload option.

   Nodes that understand the Jumbo Payload option are required to detect
   a number of possible format errors, and if the erroneous packet was
   not destined to a multicast address, report the error by sending an
   ICMP Parameter Problem message [ICMPv6] to the packet's source.   The
   following list of errors specifies the values to be used in the Code
   and Pointer fields of the Parameter Problem message:

      error: IPv6 Payload Length = 0 and
             IPv6 Next Header = Hop-by-Hop Options and
             Jumbo Payload option not present

             Code: 0
             Pointer: high-order octet of the IPv6 Payload Length

      error: IPv6 Payload Length != 0 and
             Jumbo Payload option present

             Code: 0
             Pointer: Option Type field of the Jumbo Payload option

      error: Jumbo Payload option present and
             Jumbo Payload Length < 65,536

             Code: 0
             Pointer: high-order octet of the Jumbo Payload Length

      error: Jumbo Payload option present and
             Fragment header present

             Code: 0
             Pointer: high-order octet of the Fragment header.

   A node that does not understand the Jumbo Payload option is expected
   to respond to erroneously-received jumbograms as follows, according
   to the IPv6 specification:

      error: IPv6 Payload Length = 0 and
             IPv6 Next Header = Hop-by-Hop Options

             Code: 0
             Pointer: high-order octet of the IPv6 Payload Length

      error: IPv6 Payload Length != 0 and
             Jumbo Payload option present

             Code: 2
             Pointer: Option Type field of the Jumbo Payload option
