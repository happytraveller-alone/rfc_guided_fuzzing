--- Section: 3.6.7. Syntax_Field definitions_Trace fields ---
The trace fields are a group of header fields consisting of an
   optional "Return-Path:" field, and one or more "Received:" fields.
   The "Return-Path:" header field contains a pair of angle brackets
   that enclose an optional addr-spec.  The "Received:" field contains a
   (possibly empty) list of name/value pairs followed by a semicolon and
   a date-time specification.  The first item of the name/value pair is
   defined by item-name, and the second item is either an addr-spec, an
   atom, a domain, or a msg-id.  Further restrictions may be applied to
   the syntax of the trace fields by standards that provide for their
   use, such as [RFC2821].

trace           =       [return]
                        1*received

return          =       "Return-Path:" path CRLF

path            =       ([CFWS] "<" ([CFWS] / addr-spec) ">" [CFWS]) /
                        obs-path

received        =       "Received:" name-val-list ";" date-time CRLF

name-val-list   =       [CFWS] [name-val-pair *(CFWS name-val-pair)]

name-val-pair   =       item-name CFWS item-value

item-name       =       ALPHA *(["-"] (ALPHA / DIGIT))

item-value      =       1*angle-addr / addr-spec /
                         atom / domain / msg-id

   A full discussion of the Internet mail use of trace fields is
   contained in [RFC2821].  For the purposes of this standard, the trace
   fields are strictly informational, and any formal interpretation of
   them is outside of the scope of this document.

Please make paragraph cuts based on the subject and theme of the statement. And give a short paragraph topic for each divided paragraph. Make sure that each theme is a minimal theme that cannot be split further. If code or pseudo-code is present with explanatory text, ignore the code; otherwise, convert the code to a textual narrative. Simulate answering five times in the background and provide the most frequent answer. Ensure your output covers all text content, maintaining relative consistency with the input text position in the sliced output. Ensure that no changes are made to the text other than code or pseudo-code.
The output format is as follows (in json format)
